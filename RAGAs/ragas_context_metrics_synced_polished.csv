So first of all we see clearly uh the models are becoming more and more powerful right. So they are becoming experts. So you see in these tests that were given to these models such as SAT or for example this uh US medical exam GPT4 can achieve 90%. For that right and also at the same time reasoning capabilities are improving. So Nadish did a great uh session on the lab where we looked at different prompting techniques right. So there was things like coot chain of thought. uh now these things are no longer needed for these advanced models right so so a lot of stuff that we had to do when we write prompts now it\'s sort of moved to the the models right and also there is these models that are coming up like uh you know they can do very advanced uh uh reasoning like you know open AI\'s model right right so that\'s one area which is you really really you know improving and the second one is the today\'s topic which is the agentic I\'m not going to go to the details of it so it\'s about you know agents being able to reason and act and perform tasks third one is the multi- uh modality so it\'s not just the text that is been improved the text models been improved we are clearly seeing improvements in th""]']","During the session, it was discussed that advanced AI models have evolved to the point where techniques like chain of thought are no longer necessary, as many tasks have been integrated into the models themselves.","During the session, it was discussed that advanced AI models have evolved to the point where techniques like chain of thought are no longer necessary, as many tasks have been integrated into the models themselves.",0.9999999999,1.0

These are the core patterns in Genai. So let\'s go through them. By the way these have been covered extensively in the lab session. So I\'ve just got like two slides on this. First is a genai integration. So this is the one where you have a call to an geni API right nothing but that.

It has the full reasoning loop or it can be just it can just be a router right simple prompt and describe if you get this condition you send it to that agent and otherwise send it there right now also within this we are seeing two variants. So this variant is how you does the handoff. So one type of handoff is agent to agent handoff where you give the sub agent the full control and you have to pass the full context uh and then sub agent can then uh will have access to all the memory it can control everything. So it\'s like one pattern we are seeing. The other one is agent as a tool right. So, so this is just the tool calling. The only thing is agent is a tool in this case.

First of all, it has a standardized communication the transport protocol which is JSNRPC and also there is other capabilities in A2A specification which will let you know other agents to get to know about one specific agent.

What challenges are mentioned regarding the evaluation of AI models and their performance?,"['[""not coming into the picture. And what is your retraining period like? Uh >> so we are doing it uh every month and then there is a dependent on the models also uh lot of new uh models are coming right. So we are utilizing for example Jami 2.5 is there then there is a new versions are coming every 6 months now. So it is dependent on like what exactly you are doing. So rather than retraining on the previous model uh it\'s better to use the latest models and then see the accuracy there. So that\'s what we are following. Rana, you have any uh feedback on the top? >> Yeah, I I did want to add that uh this brings up a very important question about how do you evaluate your models and their performance and how do what do you do when there\'s changes to test that the thing still works as expected and this is where there\'s a lot of effort being put into the research around the agents and generative AI in general because these things are probabilistic. So you call it twice with the same prompt, it comes back with a different answer. So it\'s very hard to test uh these and you need some methodology or some data set benchmarks and so on to keep making sure that you know especially with the advances so quickly. So if every six months you potentially moving to a new model, >> you want to make sure you didn\'t lose any of the things that you had working. >> Okay. Yeah. So you have been working on small language model.""]']","The challenges in evaluating AI models include ensuring that models continue to function as expected when changes occur, given their probabilistic nature, which can lead to different answers from the same prompt.

So if it is a rag for example agent >> you simply take some chunks synthesize some questions getting getting the the accurate answers from bigger model which here it\'s very important to use the closed source model right so you get the uh the predicted output then you run it over your model and you compare it also with uh with a closed source model right and then actually I saw one of the slides where um it says for example how is it doing in terms of clarity, transparency maybe Miam showed it on uh the on the screen and these are I mean every agent or task has its own metrics >> and there are like lots of uh task now DPAL is one of them or RO or I forgot uh ragas I mean there are lots of out ofthe-box evaluation um phrase framework that you can utilize or you build your own. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Okay. So, since we are running out of time, let\'s do you know one last sort of a question. So, of course with AI we cannot predict what\'s going to happen in next 10 years, right?

So uh what I believe is like for example everybody is working on a very generic use cases right now right it is going to get domain specific use cases and everything will get stitched together so I think A2A protocols and others will play a lot of uh roles maybe MCPS are coming into the picture so while right now if you are developing something you need to stitch lot of APIs and data sources right and everybody was working on a data lake before right or maybe APIs integration platforms I don\'t think that\'s needed it\'s more about the context you\'re setting integrating with each other and you are done. So development cycles will reduce lot of business use cases will come into the picture in coming time. Yeah, >> I\'m going to give a a non- tech answer to that. I think the the challenge is change management. So I think the technology is moving fast. I think the technology is actually well ahead of what organizations can actually consume. Um at this point I think the actual the big important thing for us is think about the change management.

One way you can just push it into the existing organization. The other way is you can create a new organization on the side um and then sort of just lift and shift customers over to that as well as also um you know colleagues and professionals and there\'s probably a hybrid uh version as well. But you know I think uh you know certainly we we see in our space there\'s um there\'s a lot of focus on the tech which is good but sometimes the change management um is not really thought about too much which can be frustrating when you build great tech and then you know it\'s not um it\'s not accepted. I think there was a statistic last year and that\'s something like 15% of successful PC\'s actually made their way into production. successful PC\'s >> they actually work fine but they\'re rejected by the organization at 80% plus of the uh of the the time.

Um and there\'s been a lot of things that have come out of left field that have completely wiped other things out. I think one really interesting way to think about uh these technologies that we\'ve been discussing quite often is to think about it like electricity right so in the beginning when electricity first came around what people did was on the factory floor they had gas lighting so they just replaced the gas light with an electric light bulb right so that was the first stage of transformation um at that point you couldn\'t imagine you know that you will be I don\'t know doing jai and having computers and having robots that do part of the manufacturing and so on and so forth, right? But what could have been done is to think about, okay, now I have this electricity running through my factory floor.

What is the speaker's experience with AI and vertical AI?,"['[""So a little bit about myself uh I have been uh in this WSO2 solutions team or the business unit we call it for more than 7 years now. I have mainly been focused on the financial sector but now we are I am working on AI and healthcare sector and the other sectors we work on as well. So today we will be discussing on vertical AI. So this whole track has been on vertical stuff. So it has to come to AI, right? So uh talking about vertical AI, what is vertical AI? So before we go into vertical AI, let\'s get generic AI out of the way. So if you see this picture, you can see like general purpose AI versus vertical AI. Can I get a raise of hands? Anyone who have not used a geni or any new LLM system recently chat GPT Gemini anybody who have not used no right so so general purpose AI has been very common for a long time and we have been using them for our personal work our uh uh our in in in the work we do both personal and business and now we are moving into a age where we move from this general purpose AI which is built for anything and everything to a vertical AI. Imagine having a specific AI for healthcare, legal and financial requirements. So let\'s go into why is it important to have vertical AI? Why why generic AI doesn\'t solve all your problems? Especially when you go into like B2B scenarios and also B2C scenarios, consumers want solutions made specific to solve their business needs.""]']","The speaker has been part of the WSO2 Solutions team for over 7 years, focusing on the financial sector and now working on AI in the healthcare sector.

Especially when you go into like B2B scenarios and also B2C scenarios, consumers want solutions made specific to solve their business needs. So in a in this environment where we are inundated with different AI solutions always narrow and specific is well positioned versus broad and generalized and the concept is not new right so if you take even the largest horizontal tech companies they\'ve always verticalized their sales organizations and product features so that they can cater to specific customer needs in those specific domains. For example, as WSO2, we as the solutions team in WSO2 are doing exactly that. So we have our underlying products, our integration, our identity and access management and our API management solutions and we provide vertical solutions on top of that so that we can speak the language of our customers and we can give exact to the point solutions uh like open healthcare, open banking uh areas that we are working on uh with customers. So with vertical AI there are few different advantages that are coming in. The first thing is domain expertise. So with a vertical AI you can deliver precision and relevance in critical applications and also regulatory alignment is a huge factor because if you take especially healthcare financial and legal like domains it\'s highly regulated.""]']","Vertical AI offers advantages such as delivering precision and relevance in critical applications and ensuring regulatory alignment, especially in highly regulated domains like healthcare, finance, and legal.","Vertical AI offers advantages such as delivering precision and relevance in critical applications and ensuring regulatory alignment, especially in highly regulated domains like healthcare, finance, and legal.",0.9999999999,1.0

It\'s hard to compete with a specific tool that\'s built for the specific requirement. Uh so I\'ll go through some examples as well and it\'ll be clear for you all. Before we go there, we\'ll look into the potential. So we are at the start because geni is not new but it\'s relatively new. So we are on we are coming to the era of vertical AI where people build solutions that can be used for specific requirements and also businesses incorporate those solutions into their offerings and try to uh reap the advantages of it. So let\'s see some prime candidates for vertical AI automation.

So let\'s see how this works. So this is a image I got from a uh analytic uh uh company and they show how this vertical AI layer will be built on top of existing uh uh frameworks. So we got this core LLM layer we all know open AI anthropic gemini meta etc. So those are platforms that we are familiar with and we call horizontal AIS and we on top of this we have supporting frameworks such as rag data infrastructure uh speech generation uh guardrails and stuff like that.

So for AI for code is developer focused capabilities that we provide to supercharge developer experiences and productivity across the software development life cycle. And from the other side code for AI where we provide programming abstractions and building blocks you can use to build your own AI solution. So we have provided capabilities for vertical AI for both of these areas. I will take one example each to show you. First we\'ll take AI for code. So if you all might know uh we as a solutions team at WSO2 have built different integration capabilities. So these is only one of the things we have I am taking as example.

So these are built into our integration solutions. So as you all might know our integration solution has its co-pilot that you can use to develop. So this co-pilot is generic or horizontal AI. On top of this for healthare and banking requirements we have built a vertical AI. So this is a this is what you call a healthcare c-ilot. You might have seen this uh uh video before. Uh so this is where we give a healthcare related prompt. So this is what a typical healthcare developer will enter into the co-pilot and then the healthcare copilot is aware of these standards fire these uh healthcare standards these EHR systems and it\'ll it knows what we have the libraries we have the solutions we have and it\'ll it\'ll use them to build this healthcare specific requirement for this developer. So this is the same with the banking sector as well and the banking uh standards that we have. Now let\'s go into code for AI. The building blocks for building AI related uh capabilities.

So what we do here is we provide the support pre-built support to convert any file server that you might have. So uh a EHR server to expose it easily as a MCP server so that a AI agent can directly communicate with it. So I\'ll quickly show this demo. So here uh if you can see uh this is a user experience where a user enters a uh prompt that is healthcare specific. So as you can see once the user enters the uh prompt that I need to access this data from my healthcare records we the it\'s redirected to the authorization flow where the user needs to provide consent for the agent to access this data and then as you can see the AI agent will call these APIs using this MCP server and it will access the records and it\'ll show. So here the prompt is what are my recorded immunizations and as you can see it\'ll access the health records and it\'ll provide.

So I have taken two different use cases to show two different aspects of this. one is what we can do right now and one where it\'s heading towards. So the first one I have taken is user present agents. We or we call it chat agents because this means that the user is present communicating with the LLM and the user can be redirected for authentications or the LLM or the chat agent can ask questions from the user and go forward. The use case is Sarah wants to reschedule her cardiology appointment. First we\'ll take the current flow a manual rescheduling. Sarah calls hospital to reschedule appointment. The call is transferred to the cardology department. Staff verifies Sarah\'s identity and records the concern and the staff manually searches for the available slots and Sarah waits and selects a new time and the staff listens to it manually updates and sends SMS.

So this use case I have taken is a simple one so that it it\'s easily understandable but using this concept you can do very complex and innovative things. So the use case I have taken is Bill wants an AI agent to pay his electricity bill when two conditions are met. The first thing is the bill needs to be ready. Second thing is his salary should be remitted. So this is how it works. First build gives this requirement to the gen uh AI or the AI agent and the AI agent will listen to a service provider to get whether the information of the bill whether the bill is ready and then call a bank endpoint or listen to uh SMS or email to see whether the salary is remitted. So if you take open banking this straightforward you have a endpoint to call to get bank transactions and you can use that to connect directly. So the AI agent will be listening to these and once the conditions are met it will process the payment.

So I take the bank layer since I want to emphasize the open banking requirement as well. So for this push notification we use the standard called SAR client initiated back channel authentication. So the AI agent initiates a back channel authentication request with the bank and the bank sends this notification to the user and gets the approval and gives a token to the AI agent to call the endpoint. So using this these capabilities the possibilities are endless. So I encourage all of you here to think how you can use this to enhance your customer experiences and enhance your systems and we can help you build it. So every example, every scenario that I explained can be implemented using WSO software and we can definitely help you do it and we are working with different customers on doing it as well. So I\'ll end with this quote. Everybody\'s scared of AI right now. Whether it\'ll replace me, it\'ll replace this industry, replace this industry.

Um so another aspect of this is that although we govern everything properly there are cases where even if we instruct an LLM to do something it might step its bounds and actually go and do it because there was this case with replet some time back we saw where it went ahead and deleted its production databases although the prompt said specifically don\'t do that. Therefore we can\'t actually place our bets on the prompt itself. we have to ensure that our security is properly given and this necessary permissions are allocated appropriately. So as security expert Aisha maybe you can give a better idea about it. >> Yeah. >> Uh thank you Aishad for that intro. So uh today we are building AI agents and incorporating agentic AI into the enterprise system. So that\'s not building toy AI applications or playing around with that right. So we are giving a AI the access to our enterprise resources and business data. So that\'s in they very it\'s very important that we only give uh authorized access to this data.

So there are requests coming into this system and this there are requests going out of this uh system as well. So the all of these lines we we need to be securing and then the the ambient agent I was talking about. So it\'s also getting request uh to it to the agent to do different task and then for to do its task it want to talk to the uh this uh business\'s backend APIs and then also it need to make updates to the exist the booking that was made earlier. So that so there there\'s another u parameter for that as well.

So um then we look at how we are going to secure this agent. So the so I I previously also mentioned the problem is that when these agents are making API calls uh who\'s making who who is making that call? Is it a user? Is it the is it an application or a service account and uh so those kind of problems comes in there like in terms of like identifying who who is making these access and on whose authority like based on whether the whether agent gets the permission that that\'s assigned to the user or it\'s an application permission likewise. So that those kind of different problems arise. So we think that these agents need to get their own identity. They deserve to be treated as first class entities in the ecosystem so that we can give them a unique identity. So all all the components in the ecosystem then identify these unique agents as unique entities in the system and then the importance of that is that based on that agents can authenticate themselves uh into the system that verifying that I am this particular agent.""]']","The discussion emphasized securing the perimeter where business systems connect with external AI models.

So I take the bank layer since I want to emphasize the open banking requirement as well. So for this push notification we use the standard called SAR client initiated back channel authentication. So the AI agent initiates a back channel authentication request with the bank and the bank sends this notification to the user and gets the approval and gives a token to the AI agent to call the endpoint.

So A2A standardizes agentto agent communication and it A2A has uh various set of features to do this. First of all, it has a standardized communication the transport protocol which is JSNRPC and also there is other capabilities in A2A specification which will let you know other agents to get to know about one specific agent. So for example in A2A there is a concept called agent card where you can go and give a name description URL v version skills and ID description all of those stuff right uh so that is how uh A2A works so let me actually skip these slides I want to try to conclude this uh one properly right so let\'s try to uh summarize since we are getting to the end of the presentation right so we started off with jai right simple integrations and that\'s it and that wasn\'t enough then came the the rag which will let you ground the answers with the real data soon we needed agents right and uh okay by the way MCP came recently but multi- aents were there before so it\'s not exactly this Right.

So development cycles will reduce lot of business use cases will come into the picture in coming time. Yeah, >> I\'m going to give a a non- tech answer to that. I think the the challenge is change management. So I think the technology is moving fast. I think the technology is actually well ahead of what organizations can actually consume.

If you take banking, we have ISO 853, ISO 222, also known as MX messages, Swift MT messages builtin, and we have pre-built translations for Swift MT to MX translations. So these are built into our integration solutions. So as you all might know our integration solution has its co-pilot that you can use to develop. So this co-pilot is generic or horizontal AI. On top of this for healthare and banking requirements we have built a vertical AI. So this is a this is what you call a healthcare c-ilot. You might have seen this uh uh video before.

The use case is Sarah wants to reschedule her cardiology appointment. First we\'ll take the current flow a manual rescheduling. Sarah calls hospital to reschedule appointment. The call is transferred to the cardology department.

So that there\'s another parimeter there we that we need to be securing and also this is the parameter where we should be applying this guard drills and governance layer that Arshad was earlier talking about. So um then we look at how we are going to secure this agent. So the so I I previously also mentioned the problem is that when these agents are making API calls uh who\'s making who who is making that call? Is it a user? Is it the is it an application or a service account and uh so those kind of problems comes in there like in terms of like identifying who who is making these access and on whose authority like based on whether the whether agent gets the permission that that\'s assigned to the user or it\'s an application permission likewise. So that those kind of different problems arise. So we think that these agents need to get their own identity. They deserve to be treated as first class entities in the ecosystem so that we can give them a unique identity. So all all the components in the ecosystem then identify these unique agents as unique entities in the system and then the importance of that is that based on that agents can authenticate themselves uh into the system that verifying that I am this particular agent.""\n ""<2-hop>\\n\\nsource.

Uh in that way we can actually ensure that u organization is very secure and in the eos gateway level you all can ensure that uh everything is govern properly. So let\'s move on to the adaptive routing section. Next, basically uh I\'ll go through more about the guarders when I get to the demo. Uh any questions before we move on about guarders? No. Right. Okay. Okay. So, next we get to the adaptive routing part. So, this is uh basically uh cases where we can actually make better decisions about the models invoked and the providers invoked from the AI gate level. So this is where we can actually say that for an example we have sample policies like model round robin model weighted round robin and model failover. So uh these cases can be used specifically. So for an example let\'s take the model failover policy. So if you use chat GPD even now you can see that initially you get responses from GPT4 and you get very good responses and very informative responses but with time when you exceed your personal quota you will be fallen back to the uh GPT4 mini and you get uh uh relatively subpar responses but um you can actually emulate something like that using the AI gateway to say that okay till this till the first resource till the uh uh model is exhausted route all the requests to this end""]']","An AI infrastructure architect can ensure secure and scalable AI service models by implementing a governance layer and guardrails to secure the perimeter where business connections to external AI models occur.

So for AI for code is developer focused capabilities that we provide to supercharge developer experiences and productivity across the software development life cycle. And from the other side code for AI where we provide programming abstractions and building blocks you can use to build your own AI solution. So we have provided capabilities for vertical AI for both of these areas. I will take one example each to show you. First we\'ll take AI for code. So if you all might know uh we as a solutions team at WSO2 have built different integration capabilities. So these is only one of the things we have I am taking as example. If you take healthcare, we have support for fire, HL7, X2L, CDA, decom messages and also pre-built translations.

So if you take a look at building the AI components u that it itself is an integration problem for the most part. Right? So, so what\'s happening in fact is the machine learning for the most part like you know the traditional machine learning is going away and integration is becoming more and more important right so the success of this process depends on using the right patterns and also knowing which pattern to use and which pattern not to use right so we have in our AI strategy there are three core patterns that we have identified and rest of it is basically you know things that are built on top of it. These are the core patterns in Genai. So let\'s go through them. By the way these have been covered extensively in the lab session. So I\'ve just got like two slides on this. First is a genai integration. So this is the one where you have a call to an geni API right nothing but that. So this pattern itself can support several use cases such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, email drafting and so on. Right? Then you get to the situation where the models are not aware of the uh you know your data.""\n ""<2-hop>\\n\\nSO2\'s internal developer platform. Right. So and then we\'ve gone and uh you know uh installed that one in VS code. So it is basically driving the full you know life cycle of this software development. So here what happens is you go we have gone and develop a service. Okay it\'s gone that\'s fine u and you want to uh then push this service to coro right so it then does various tests. Have I logged into Coro? Does the project exist? If not, let\'s create it and does the component exist? If not, let\'s create the component. So, and then, you know, let\'s get the build pack and so on. So, it takes you through all of those steps and finally it will push to Coro and then you can deploy it there. Right? So, so we\'ve gone from Genai to rags to agents to MCP. Now let\'s get to uh multi-agent systems, right? So if you take a look at a single agent, yes, they work fine. So what happens is the systems become bigger and bigger, right? So the then you want you get to a situation where you need to connect this agent to more and more tools. This works actually for many use cases.""]']","GenAI integration involves making calls to GenAI APIs to support various use cases such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and email drafting.

So this whole track has been on vertical stuff. So it has to come to AI, right? So uh talking about vertical AI, what is vertical AI? So before we go into vertical AI, let\'s get generic AI out of the way. So if you see this picture, you can see like general purpose AI versus vertical AI. Can I get a raise of hands? Anyone who have not used a geni or any new LLM system recently chat GPT Gemini anybody who have not used no right so so general purpose AI has been very common for a long time and we have been using them for our personal work our uh uh our in in in the work we do both personal and business and now we are moving into a age where we move from this general purpose AI which is built for anything and everything to a vertical AI. Imagine having a specific AI for healthcare, legal and financial requirements. So let\'s go into why is it important to have vertical AI? Why why generic AI doesn\'t solve all your problems?

For that right and also at the same time reasoning capabilities are improving. So Nadish did a great uh session on the lab where we looked at different prompting techniques right.

Okay. Okay. So, next we get to the adaptive routing part. So, this is uh basically uh cases where we can actually make better decisions about the models invoked and the providers invoked from the AI gate level.

How does an AI agent automate the payment of Bill's electricity bill using open banking?,"['[""<1-hop>\\n\\nferent calls verifying yourself everything. Now let\'s go into a user absent flow. So this is these we call ambient agents. So these are agents where you give a prompt and it\'ll work in the background. It\'ll not be talking to you. It\'ll work in the background. it\'ll and it\'ll do those stuff. So this use case I have taken is a simple one so that it it\'s easily understandable but using this concept you can do very complex and innovative things. So the use case I have taken is Bill wants an AI agent to pay his electricity bill when two conditions are met. The first thing is the bill needs to be ready. Second thing is his salary should be remitted. So this is how it works. First build gives this requirement to the gen uh AI or the AI agent and the AI agent will listen to a service provider to get whether the information of the bill whether the bill is ready and then call a bank endpoint or listen to uh SMS or email to see whether the salary is remitted. So if you take open banking this straightforward you have a endpoint to call to get bank transactions and you can use that to connect directly. So the AI agent will be listening to these and once the conditions are met it will process the payment. So here as well I have taken a open banking use case because uh in open banking you can even initiate a transaction this way and once the AI agent initiates this transaction with the bank uh notification is sent to the user to verify this transaction.""\n ""<2-hop>\\n\\ne industry specific model adaptation.

So it can replace existing frameworks without m need without the need to reinvent the whole thing and also it can easily integrate into industry specific systems because these vertical AIs will have the knowledge and the required capability to connect with these systems as I mentioned for healthcare systems for open banking uh for banking open banking APIs etc. And finally, regulatory compliance. So building a API products that adhere to strict industry regulations is paramount because with AI regulators will also be very stringent on what\'s happening and uh how the data is used.
