What insights did Nadish provide during the session on prompting techniques for advanced AI models?,"[""s is an art summary of an article that was uh why that one works right >> this one. >> Yeah. Okay. Summary of an article that was published by McKenzie. Uh uh so I've uh let me take you through these. So these are the key innovations which they identify uh as driving the current AI adaption. So first of all we see clearly uh the models are becoming more and more powerful right. So they are becoming experts. So you see in these tests that were given to these models such as SAT or for example this uh US medical exam GPT4 can achieve 90%. For that right and also at the same time reasoning capabilities are improving. So Nadish did a great uh session on the lab where we looked at different prompting techniques right. So there was things like coot chain of thought. uh now these things are no longer needed for these advanced models right so so a lot of stuff that we had to do when we write prompts now it's sort of moved to the the models right and also there is these models that are coming up like uh you know they can do very advanced uh uh reasoning like you know open AI's model right right so that's one area which is you really really you know improving and the second one is the today's topic which is the agentic I'm not going to go to the details of it so it's about you know agents being able to reason and act and perform tasks third one is the multi- uh modality so it's not just the text that is been improved the text models been improved we are clearly seeing improvements in th""]","Nadish conducted a session in the lab where different prompting techniques were explored.

For example, video voice, right? If you've gone and talked to unitary dog outside, you know, the the interactions are becoming more natural and becoming real time and also the hardware uh innovation, right? So for the most part there's a lot of people are still having issues with scalability, right? Scaling AI is a big problem. So we are seeing like the the speed is improving and which is we been able to support these realtime uh extraction uh you know interactions and these capabilities being you know able to access on the cloud and also on the edge. The other one is transparency and explanability. So those who worked in this area you know like this is an issue anyway for machine learning right? So uh it is still an issue but we are clearly seeing progress. So there's this score called transparency score. I'm not sure whether you have heard of it. Basically it's a metric that will you know look at uh you know how transparent are these companies when it comes to training these models when in terms of the data or you know when the models respond and so on.""]","A transparency score is a metric that evaluates how transparent companies are regarding the training of AI models, including aspects such as data usage and model responses.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

So if an agent does something then we have some level of you know understanding of what it does right okay oops right so bit about uh you know building modern AI applications so this is how we model this so uh so building modern AI applications is about you know uh connecting things together So the way we model this is you have to first build these AI components. I'll get to that in a minute. And then integrate these AI components with the other components uh that are in the system. Right?

These are the core patterns in Genai. So let's go through them. By the way these have been covered extensively in the lab session. So I've just got like two slides on this. First is a genai integration. So this is the one where you have a call to an geni API right nothing but that.

Waht is the purpsoe of MCP in AI applicatoins and how does it standardize the interaciton with external tools?,"[""it will go and do a search on the internet and it creates a personalized profile and and that agent uses two tools because remember the agents can uh you know interact with tools and perform actions. The first one is you call the surfer API where you will get set of links related to me right so I do a Google and then get a set of links and then you go and scrape the content which is what the second one do it's called scraper web scraper API right so this is not just two calls it happens times until it uh reset reaches its goal right so the next thing I want to talk about is multiple multi-agent systems but before that I want to briefly touch on MCP uh because this is something that we you know we all are aware of and we've discussed extensively in the AI labs now we know that there's an agent and there's set of tools which the agent is interacting with right so the problem that the MCP solves is MCP standardizes the way in which the AI applications s interact with these external tools, right? Uh now you can see the architecture here. So MCP has concepts like tools which is the same as the zoom tool that we were talking about resources prompts and and so on.

Have I logged into Coro? Does the project exist? If not, let's create it and does the component exist? If not, let's create the component. So, and then, you know, let's get the build pack and so on. So, it takes you through all of those steps and finally it will push to Coro and then you can deploy it there. Right? So, so we've gone from Genai to rags to agents to MCP. Now let's get to uh multi-agent systems, right? So if you take a look at a single agent, yes, they work fine. So what happens is the systems become bigger and bigger, right?

What coro copilot do and how it help with choreo platform?,"[""to invoke next. Now this supervisor agent which is the the top level agent, it can be a full react agent like you know we we we we spoke about react in the lab session agent that will reason and act. It has the full reasoning loop or it can be just it can just be a router right simple prompt and describe if you get this condition you send it to that agent and otherwise send it there right now also within this we are seeing two variants. So this variant is how you does the handoff. So one type of handoff is agent to agent handoff where you give the sub agent the full control and you have to pass the full context uh and then sub agent can then uh will have access to all the memory it can control everything. So it's like one pattern we are seeing. The other one is agent as a tool right. So, so this is just the tool calling. The only thing is agent is a tool in this case. So, this way you don't give the full control and also you only give specific uh sort of pass specific uh inputs and outputs. Right? Okay. So, this is a uh this is some I don't have time to do a demo on this. This is one of the co-pilots that we have built. So, this is coro copilot. By the way, we are revamping this and there's another version that is coming up. What coro copilot does is it will let you interact with the coro platform. So we have had like several sessions on choreo. You can ask about the projects documentation, ask about like what services are having issues and so on.

So coro we have observability coro we have marketplace coro we have testing lot of things right.

So there's if there's an observability team of course they can work with the II team as well they can they are the best teams to write the prompts to this agent right so what it happens is so if you take a look at one of these agents for example observability agents coro has lot of internal APIs right uh so it connects to those internal APIs and get the data out and also can so in observability case there's no action performance performing it's basically the retrieval but when it comes to other things like deployment that can also be done right so right so we've looked at uh geni uh rags agents mcp right and then uh multi- aent system so there are clearly we are seeing patterns Right.

Uh which that tries to standardize the agentto agent communication like how MCP standardized the AI applications to tools communication. So M MCP complements agent to agent communication right now. Uh again these things are still evolving. So there's number of protocols that are there.

So I'm not going to go to the go to lot of details but I just want to give a high level you know idea about that. So if you are building a multi- aent system which we saw before you have multiple agents communicating in you know different ways. Uh now one agent does not know what the other agent does right. So that problem is there. For example, uh what skill that this other agent has, what data format that I need to send it to, right? Uh and what it what does it return? What are the data types? Is it text, video, uh voice and so on, right?""]","ACP, or agent communication protocol by IBM, is one of the protocols that standardizes agent-to-agent communication, addressing issues like understanding what skills other agents have, the data format needed for communication, and the types of data returned.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

So A2A standardizes agentto agent communication and it A2A has uh various set of features to do this. First of all, it has a standardized communication the transport protocol which is JSNRPC and also there is other capabilities in A2A specification which will let you know other agents to get to know about one specific agent. So for example in A2A there is a concept called agent card where you can go and give a name description URL v version skills and ID description all of those stuff right uh so that is how uh A2A works so let me actually skip these slides I want to try to conclude this uh one properly right so let's try to uh summarize since we are getting to the end of the presentation right so we started off with jai right simple integrations and that's it and that wasn't enough then came the the rag which will let you ground the answers with the real data soon we needed agents right and uh okay by the way MCP came recently but multi- aents were there before so it's not exactly this Right. Um I'm trying to build the story from complexity smallest complexity to bigger. Right. So yes, MCP was there. MCP standardizes how the AI applications not necessarily agents.""]","A2A standardizes agent-to-agent communication by providing a standardized communication transport protocol, which is JSNRPC.

Then you need a standard for these agents to uh communicate right. This is where the agent to agent protocols are coming up and A2A is one of them.

And if we look at traditional data science teams that are mainly folks that were usually working with Excel files, small data, uh potentially in notebooks and doing things just once as we get into AI and generative AI capability, we get much closer to distributed systems. And then even if you have a model now, you need to connect it to streaming data. You need it to be live. you need potentially real-time responses, latency matters.

Anthropic models good?,"[""m early on in journeys with AI engineers is they will optimize for accuracy first. >> Yeah. >> Because they don't want to get complaints from the users that it's hallucinating and giving a bad answer. >> So they usually go and buy the the biggest and most expensive model that's available on the market and and start with that which is a good place to to start. >> Um but then quickly you realize that there those models are you know inefficient. um there's there's high latency on them.

One way you can just push it into the existing organization. The other way is you can create a new organization on the side um and then sort of just lift and shift customers over to that as well as also um you know colleagues and professionals and there's probably a hybrid uh version as well. But you know I think uh you know certainly we we see in our space there's um there's a lot of focus on the tech which is good but sometimes the change management um is not really thought about too much which can be frustrating when you build great tech and then you know it's not um it's not accepted.

Uh this stuff is moving so quickly. Um and there's been a lot of things that have come out of left field that have completely wiped other things out. I think one really interesting way to think about uh these technologies that we've been discussing quite often is to think about it like electricity right so in the beginning when electricity first came around what people did was on the factory floor they had gas lighting so they just replaced the gas light with an electric light bulb right so that was the first stage of transformation um at that point you couldn't imagine you know that you will be I don't know doing jai and having computers and having robots that do part of the manufacturing and so on and so forth, right? But what could have been done is to think about, okay, now I have this electricity running through my factory floor. How can I reimag what it enables and rethink the work that I do given this capability and that is going to be transformational and I think it will be very disruptive in a good way, right? like things will really accelerate but I think companies that don't think about it that way are going to be much slower.""]","The future of AI is uncertain and rapidly evolving, with many developments coming unexpectedly.

What is the role of WSO2 in the context of vertical AI?,"[""So a little bit about myself uh I have been uh in this WSO2 solutions team or the business unit we call it for more than 7 years now. I have mainly been focused on the financial sector but now we are I am working on AI and healthcare sector and the other sectors we work on as well. So today we will be discussing on vertical AI. So this whole track has been on vertical stuff. So it has to come to AI, right? So uh talking about vertical AI, what is vertical AI? So before we go into vertical AI, let's get generic AI out of the way. So if you see this picture, you can see like general purpose AI versus vertical AI. Can I get a raise of hands? Anyone who have not used a geni or any new LLM system recently chat GPT Gemini anybody who have not used no right so so general purpose AI has been very common for a long time and we have been using them for our personal work our uh uh our in in in the work we do both personal and business and now we are moving into a age where we move from this general purpose AI which is built for anything and everything to a vertical AI. Imagine having a specific AI for healthcare, legal and financial requirements. So let's go into why is it important to have vertical AI? Why why generic AI doesn't solve all your problems? Especially when you go into like B2B scenarios and also B2C scenarios, consumers want solutions made specific to solve their business needs.""]","The context does not provide specific information about the role of WSO2 in vertical AI.

Especially when you go into like B2B scenarios and also B2C scenarios, consumers want solutions made specific to solve their business needs. So in a in this environment where we are inundated with different AI solutions always narrow and specific is well positioned versus broad and generalized and the concept is not new right so if you take even the largest horizontal tech companies they've always verticalized their sales organizations and product features so that they can cater to specific customer needs in those specific domains. For example, as WSO2, we as the solutions team in WSO2 are doing exactly that. So we have our underlying products, our integration, our identity and access management and our API management solutions and we provide vertical solutions on top of that so that we can speak the language of our customers and we can give exact to the point solutions uh like open healthcare, open banking uh areas that we are working on uh with customers. So with vertical AI there are few different advantages that are coming in. The first thing is domain expertise. So with a vertical AI you can deliver precision and relevance in critical applications and also regulatory alignment is a huge factor because if you take especially healthcare financial and legal like domains it's highly regulated.""]","In B2C scenarios, vertical AI offers advantages such as delivering precision and relevance in critical applications and ensuring regulatory alignment, especially in highly regulated domains like healthcare, finance, and legal.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How is AI used in healthcare for regulatory compliance?,"[""eliver precision and relevance in critical applications and also regulatory alignment is a huge factor because if you take especially healthcare financial and legal like domains it's highly regulated. The regulators look into every data that is shared and every communication that's made whether there's any unwanted information shared and whe whether there's a misuse of technology there and the business impact you can drive automation and insights tailored to specific verticals that a generic solution will not cater. also the competitive advantage. It's hard to compete with a specific tool that's built for the specific requirement. Uh so I'll go through some examples as well and it'll be clear for you all. Before we go there, we'll look into the potential. So we are at the start because geni is not new but it's relatively new. So we are on we are coming to the era of vertical AI where people build solutions that can be used for specific requirements and also businesses incorporate those solutions into their offerings and try to uh reap the advantages of it. So let's see some prime candidates for vertical AI automation. So any repetitive industry specific tasks particularly administrative roles where optimization is a priority routine processes repetitive routine processes that involve regulatory compliance making them ideal for airdriven efficiencies. So things like claim processing, medical billing, documentation, customer support can be early adapters.""]","AI is used in healthcare to automate and optimize repetitive industry-specific tasks, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, such as claim processing and medical billing.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

So by automating tasks that require human expertise, this vertical AI layer can boost productivity and efficiency, freeing employees to focus on high impact work and not repetitive everyday work. So let's see how this works. So this is a image I got from a uh analytic uh uh company and they show how this vertical AI layer will be built on top of existing uh uh frameworks. So we got this core LLM layer we all know open AI anthropic gemini meta etc. So those are platforms that we are familiar with and we call horizontal AIS and we on top of this we have supporting frameworks such as rag data infrastructure uh speech generation uh guardrails and stuff like that. And this vertical lay layer, it brings industry specific model tuning and regulatory compliance. Some validations uh and stuff needed for regulatory compliance and also one of the most important things is integration to industry specific systems. For example, if you take healthcare, it can be HR system. For finance, it can be a open banking system which requires specific requirements in authentication and and the data level. Let's take an example. We'll take a healthcare customer support requirement.""]","Anthropic is part of the core LLM layer, which includes platforms like OpenAI and Gemini, known as horizontal AIs.

What Sierra Decagon do in customer support AI?,"[""For finance, it can be a open banking system which requires specific requirements in authentication and and the data level. Let's take an example. We'll take a healthcare customer support requirement. At the base layer, we have foundational models or LLMs from companies like OpenAI which provide these generalpurpose language capabilities built on top of these foundational models. We have companies like Sierra Decagon to add a horizontal customer support framework that are that's one step more optimized for customer support requirements. And on top of this uh on top of this we'll have the vertical AI layer which will make it truly effective for customer support for healthcare specific requirements. For example, it'll have clinical expertise. It'll have compliance with healthcare regulations and it'll have integrations with electronic health record systems and other systems that are exposed by a hospital. Without this tailored vertical layer, this AI solution will not have the necessary understanding of the healthcare nuances that this AI needs to have and the regulatory constraints that will hinder a real world deployment. So let's quickly go through some of these value additions the boxes we saw in the vertical AI layer. So it will have industry specific model adaptation.

So it can replace existing frameworks without m need without the need to reinvent the whole thing and also it can easily integrate into industry specific systems because these vertical AIs will have the knowledge and the required capability to connect with these systems as I mentioned for healthcare systems for open banking uh for banking open banking APIs etc. And finally, regulatory compliance. So building a API products that adhere to strict industry regulations is paramount because with AI regulators will also be very stringent on what's happening and uh how the data is used. So this image is kind of a uh small demonstration on what's happening at the moment.

What is the role of fire in healthcare integration?,"[""that have been introduced and uh are being adopted at the moment. So if you take different regions even sub sub even within a vertical you have sub uh areas to be exactly specific to the requirement. Uh now I'll just talk a little bit about what we as the solutions team at WSO2 are doing in this sector. So we don't provide a full AI solution, right? We are not catering to customers. So what we do is we do two things. The first thing we do is you would have seen this slide multiple times throughout this conference. So here it is again AI for code code for AI. So for AI for code is developer focused capabilities that we provide to supercharge developer experiences and productivity across the software development life cycle. And from the other side code for AI where we provide programming abstractions and building blocks you can use to build your own AI solution. So we have provided capabilities for vertical AI for both of these areas. I will take one example each to show you. First we'll take AI for code. So if you all might know uh we as a solutions team at WSO2 have built different integration capabilities. So these is only one of the things we have I am taking as example. If you take healthcare, we have support for fire, HL7, X2L, CDA, decom messages and also pre-built translations. Fire to HL7 to fire, X2L to fire, CCDA to fire.""]","In healthcare integration, fire is supported for pre-built translations such as Fire to HL7, X2L to Fire, and CCDA to Fire.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
What role does X2L play in healthcare integration solutions?,"[""things we have I am taking as example. If you take healthcare, we have support for fire, HL7, X2L, CDA, decom messages and also pre-built translations. Fire to HL7 to fire, X2L to fire, CCDA to fire. If you take banking, we have ISO 853, ISO 222, also known as MX messages, Swift MT messages builtin, and we have pre-built translations for Swift MT to MX translations. So these are built into our integration solutions. So as you all might know our integration solution has its co-pilot that you can use to develop. So this co-pilot is generic or horizontal AI. On top of this for healthare and banking requirements we have built a vertical AI. So this is a this is what you call a healthcare c-ilot. You might have seen this uh uh video before. Uh so this is where we give a healthcare related prompt. So this is what a typical healthcare developer will enter into the co-pilot and then the healthcare copilot is aware of these standards fire these uh healthcare standards these EHR systems and it'll it knows what we have the libraries we have the solutions we have and it'll it'll use them to build this healthcare specific requirement for this developer. So this is the same with the banking sector as well and the banking uh standards that we have. Now let's go into code for AI. The building blocks for building AI related uh capabilities. So the example I had taken is any fire server as MCP server. So you all might know the MCP servers.""]","X2L is supported in healthcare integration solutions, allowing for translations such as X2L to FHIR, which are built into the integration solutions.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How AI work with MCP server for healthcare data?,"[""we have. Now let's go into code for AI. The building blocks for building AI related uh capabilities. So the example I had taken is any fire server as MCP server. So you all might know the MCP servers. You all might have heard in our sessions we have had what MCP server does is it it converts a standard API into a tool that agent can easily communicate with. So what we do here is we provide the support pre-built support to convert any file server that you might have. So uh a EHR server to expose it easily as a MCP server so that a AI agent can directly communicate with it. So I'll quickly show this demo. So here uh if you can see uh this is a user experience where a user enters a uh prompt that is healthcare specific. So as you can see once the user enters the uh prompt that I need to access this data from my healthcare records we the it's redirected to the authorization flow where the user needs to provide consent for the agent to access this data and then as you can see the AI agent will call these APIs using this MCP server and it will access the records and it'll show. So here the prompt is what are my recorded immunizations and as you can see it'll access the health records and it'll provide. So uh uh horizontal AI will not be able to do this because it will not have the knowledge of how to call these EHR systems and uh uh also it needs to be enabled from the server side via uh MCP server.""]","AI works with the MCP server by converting a standard API into a tool that an AI agent can easily communicate with.

So I have taken two different use cases to show two different aspects of this. one is what we can do right now and one where it's heading towards. So the first one I have taken is user present agents. We or we call it chat agents because this means that the user is present communicating with the LLM and the user can be redirected for authentications or the LLM or the chat agent can ask questions from the user and go forward. The use case is Sarah wants to reschedule her cardiology appointment. First we'll take the current flow a manual rescheduling. Sarah calls hospital to reschedule appointment. The call is transferred to the cardology department. Staff verifies Sarah's identity and records the concern and the staff manually searches for the available slots and Sarah waits and selects a new time and the staff listens to it manually updates and sends SMS. So what are the main problems here? So it's time consuming.""]","EHR systems are integral to AI solutions in healthcare as they require specialized knowledge to interact with, which horizontal AI lacks. AI capabilities need to be enabled from the server side via an MCP server to effectively work with EHR systems.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How open banking help AI agent pay bills?,"[""ferent calls verifying yourself everything. Now let's go into a user absent flow. So this is these we call ambient agents. So these are agents where you give a prompt and it'll work in the background. It'll not be talking to you. It'll work in the background. it'll and it'll do those stuff. So this use case I have taken is a simple one so that it it's easily understandable but using this concept you can do very complex and innovative things. So the use case I have taken is Bill wants an AI agent to pay his electricity bill when two conditions are met. The first thing is the bill needs to be ready. Second thing is his salary should be remitted. So this is how it works. First build gives this requirement to the gen uh AI or the AI agent and the AI agent will listen to a service provider to get whether the information of the bill whether the bill is ready and then call a bank endpoint or listen to uh SMS or email to see whether the salary is remitted. So if you take open banking this straightforward you have a endpoint to call to get bank transactions and you can use that to connect directly. So the AI agent will be listening to these and once the conditions are met it will process the payment. So here as well I have taken a open banking use case because uh in open banking you can even initiate a transaction this way and once the AI agent initiates this transaction with the bank uh notification is sent to the user to verify this transaction.""]","In open banking, you have an endpoint to call to get bank transactions, which allows the AI agent to connect directly.

What can WSO software be used for in open banking?,"[""e because uh in open banking you can even initiate a transaction this way and once the AI agent initiates this transaction with the bank uh notification is sent to the user to verify this transaction. So we call this user in the loop flows where uh it's a gen AI agent term that's used. So whenever this push notification can be implemented from the AI layer AI agent layer or the bank layer. So I take the bank layer since I want to emphasize the open banking requirement as well. So for this push notification we use the standard called SAR client initiated back channel authentication. So the AI agent initiates a back channel authentication request with the bank and the bank sends this notification to the user and gets the approval and gives a token to the AI agent to call the endpoint. So using this these capabilities the possibilities are endless. So I encourage all of you here to think how you can use this to enhance your customer experiences and enhance your systems and we can help you build it. So every example, every scenario that I explained can be implemented using WSO software and we can definitely help you do it and we are working with different customers on doing it as well. So I'll end with this quote. Everybody's scared of AI right now. Whether it'll replace me, it'll replace this industry, replace this industry. But innovation is always the ability to see change as an opportunity, not a threat. These are quote by Steve Jobs that's very relevant to these days.""]","WSO software can be used to implement user in the loop flows in open banking, where an AI agent initiates a back channel authentication request with the bank.

So that there's another parimeter there we that we need to be securing and also this is the parameter where we should be applying this guard drills and governance layer that Arshad was earlier talking about. So um then we look at how we are going to secure this agent. So the so I I previously also mentioned the problem is that when these agents are making API calls uh who's making who who is making that call? Is it a user? Is it the is it an application or a service account and uh so those kind of problems comes in there like in terms of like identifying who who is making these access and on whose authority like based on whether the whether agent gets the permission that that's assigned to the user or it's an application permission likewise. So that those kind of different problems arise. So we think that these agents need to get their own identity. They deserve to be treated as first class entities in the ecosystem so that we can give them a unique identity. So all all the components in the ecosystem then identify these unique agents as unique entities in the system and then the importance of that is that based on that agents can authenticate themselves uh into the system that verifying that I am this particular agent.""]","Arshad discussed the importance of securing the perimeter where connections occur between business systems and external AI models.

I'll just give uh and I can give a description if needed and then uh the system will generate a unique ID and a secret for you so that you can use uh this secret uh to configure different other type of conf credentials or authenticate UI as a agent to the uh system when it's in uh action.

So development cycles will reduce lot of business use cases will come into the picture in coming time. Yeah, >> I'm going to give a a non- tech answer to that. I think the the challenge is change management. So I think the technology is moving fast. I think the technology is actually well ahead of what organizations can actually consume. Um at this point I think the actual the big important thing for us is think about the change management.

If you take banking, we have ISO 853, ISO 222, also known as MX messages, Swift MT messages builtin, and we have pre-built translations for Swift MT to MX translations. So these are built into our integration solutions. So as you all might know our integration solution has its co-pilot that you can use to develop. So this co-pilot is generic or horizontal AI. On top of this for healthare and banking requirements we have built a vertical AI. So this is a this is what you call a healthcare c-ilot. You might have seen this uh uh video before.

We or we call it chat agents because this means that the user is present communicating with the LLM and the user can be redirected for authentications or the LLM or the chat agent can ask questions from the user and go forward. The use case is Sarah wants to reschedule her cardiology appointment. First we'll take the current flow a manual rescheduling. Sarah calls hospital to reschedule appointment. The call is transferred to the cardology department. Staff verifies Sarah's identity and records the concern and the staff manually searches for the available slots and Sarah waits and selects a new time and the staff listens to it manually updates and sends SMS.

How does the integration of AI agents in open banking enhance customer experiences while ensuring regulatory compliance?,"[""<1-hop>\n\ne because uh in open banking you can even initiate a transaction this way and once the AI agent initiates this transaction with the bank uh notification is sent to the user to verify this transaction.

So, in the short term uh how do you see that this is going and what would be the main challenges uh in short term? Let's start with uh Mahesh. So uh what I believe is like for example everybody is working on a very generic use cases right now right it is going to get domain specific use cases and everything will get stitched together so I think A2A protocols and others will play a lot of uh roles maybe MCPS are coming into the picture so while right now if you are developing something you need to stitch lot of APIs and data sources right and everybody was working on a data lake before right or maybe APIs integration platforms I don't think that's needed it's more about the context you're setting integrating with each other and you are done. So development cycles will reduce lot of business use cases will come into the picture in coming time. Yeah, >> I'm going to give a a non- tech answer to that. I think the the challenge is change management. So I think the technology is moving fast. I think the technology is actually well ahead of what organizations can actually consume. Um at this point I think the actual the big important thing for us is think about the change management. So think about the people think about the processes you know bringing colleagues along on this journey particularly those that are going to get impacted uh from AI I think is is a real real challenge.""]","A2A protocols are crucial in the evolution of AI applications as they provide a standardized method for multi-agent communication, which is essential as agents become more capable and autonomous. This evolution is part of a broader trend where AI applications are moving from single-agent to multi-agent systems, requiring new communication standards like A2A. However, organizations face significant challenges in adopting these technologies, primarily due to the rapid pace of technological advancement outstripping the ability of organizations to consume and integrate these changes. Change management, including adapting processes and bringing colleagues along on the AI journey, is a major challenge as organizations work to integrate these advanced AI systems into their operations.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

So the use case I have taken is Bill wants an AI agent to pay his electricity bill when two conditions are met. The first thing is the bill needs to be ready. Second thing is his salary should be remitted. So this is how it works. First build gives this requirement to the gen uh AI or the AI agent and the AI agent will listen to a service provider to get whether the information of the bill whether the bill is ready and then call a bank endpoint or listen to uh SMS or email to see whether the salary is remitted. So if you take open banking this straightforward you have a endpoint to call to get bank transactions and you can use that to connect directly. So the AI agent will be listening to these and once the conditions are met it will process the payment. So here as well I have taken a open banking use case because uh in open banking you can even initiate a transaction this way and once the AI agent initiates this transaction with the bank uh notification is sent to the user to verify this transaction."", ""<2-hop>\n\ne industry specific model adaptation. It'll have spec specialized knowledge and terminology that a healthcare specific customer will know and it'll be more relevant and accurate for their requirement. So these kind of stuff can be built only by using proprietary uh data for that specific vertical and task specific logic. So in incorporating industry specific workflows and decision-m logic that align with established processes. This ensures that the AI can seamlessly support complex role specific tasks. So it can replace existing frameworks without m need without the need to reinvent the whole thing and also it can easily integrate into industry specific systems because these vertical AIs will have the knowledge and the required capability to connect with these systems as I mentioned for healthcare systems for open banking uh for banking open banking APIs etc. And finally, regulatory compliance. So building a API products that adhere to strict industry regulations is paramount because with AI regulators will also be very stringent on what's happening and uh how the data is used. So this image is kind of a uh small demonstration on what's happening at the moment. So u on top of these horizontal AIs these are some of the vertical AIs that are that have been introduced and uh are being adopted at the moment. So if you take different regions even sub sub even within a vertical you have sub uh areas to be exactly specific to the requirement.""]","The AI agent uses open banking to pay Bill's electricity bill by listening to a service provider to check if the bill is ready and monitoring bank transactions to confirm if Bill's salary has been remitted.
