Now sort of moved into uh AI um so I worked very closely with the product teams and also helped to define the AI strategy for WSO2. So we have two sides of our AI strategy.

The other one is we called code for AI and that is all about building AI applications. What are the abstractions that are needed to build these AI apps?

What changes were made to the WSO2 mobile app after the last WSO2 to con?,"[""ther two patterns which we have described earlier and the agents. Now let's try to define what an agent is. So the definition of an agent is sort of vague but this is our definition of an agent right? uh uh so uh so agent is a system or an entity uh you know that can perform task by interacting with tools now these tools can be APIs and databases and so on with the help of a large language model right uh right so let's take a look at this uh application which we have built so this is a WSO2 mobile app we were building this uh towards the uh last uh WSO2 to con. So it we had sort of a very you know static kind of app. It didn't have any you know AI experiences so any personalized experience. So what we wanted to do is to make it better by bringing some you know personalized feeling. So then we uh you we ended up adding various features. For example it it can now give you know this personalized schedule. You have a chatbot where you can interact with uh uh these u u by the way if you haven't updated I think there has been a recent update right so please go ahead and uh update the app. Yeah let's take a look at the architecture before and after. So what we had was uh on my uh on the left hand side which basically had only two flows. One is the registration flow where you go to a website and then you register right.""]","The WSO2 mobile app was initially a static app without AI or personalized experiences.

What is the role of the MCP hoast in agentic applications?,"[""it will go and do a search on the internet and it creates a personalized profile and and that agent uses two tools because remember the agents can uh you know interact with tools and perform actions. The first one is you call the surfer API where you will get set of links related to me right so I do a Google and then get a set of links and then you go and scrape the content which is what the second one do it's called scraper web scraper API right so this is not just two calls it happens times until it uh reset reaches its goal right so the next thing I want to talk about is multiple multi-agent systems but before that I want to briefly touch on MCP uh because this is something that we you know we all are aware of and we've discussed extensively in the AI labs now we know that there's an agent and there's set of tools which the agent is interacting with right so the problem that the MCP solves is MCP standardizes the way in which the AI applications s interact with these external tools, right? Uh now you can see the architecture here. So MCP has concepts like tools which is the same as the zoom tool that we were talking about resources prompts and and so on. We've discussed these things in the lab, right? So so uh so it's a specification and it introduces two new components to your agentic application.

Right? So as far as the the people who wants to expose certain functionality so what does this provide? They don't have to worry about how it is being consumed by the clients. They will just build the MCP server which we will provide through our products as well. and then uh you can make it available so that uh MCP clients can consume. So let me see uh so there's a video here. All right, it works. So this is one of the recent MCP service which we have built.
