Waht is the role of machine learnig in AI?,"[""## [115.60s] Defining AI and Generative AI\nSo what is AI? I mean AI is anything that can simulate human intelligence. It can be a small function as it can be a machine learning model. It can be a very big deep learning model and it's anything that actually simulate human intelligence. And what is actually the generative AI? So generative is again a subset of artificial intelligent where we are actually focusing on creating original content that can be text that can be audio that can be visual stuff I mean it's basically focusing on creating or generating more content and what is uh large language models or LLMs so this is I mean uh example of like chat GPT open AI all the stuff right those are large language models what is that and that is actually a again a subset of generative AI but focus on natural language so understanding text generating text and that's what it's specialization.""]","Machine learning is a component of AI that can simulate human intelligence, ranging from small functions to large deep learning models.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
Why is macheen learning more accessible now compared to the pre-eni era?,"[""## [185.36s] The Current State of AI\nOkay now another thing I want to discuss a little bit is why now I mean why we are talking about AI now I mean AI was there for a long time people are trying to build a lot of stuff with AI but now it things have changed right something has changed so I think the key thing is unlike before unlike the pre-eni era now AI is for everybody it's not just for the AI developer or the that machine learning expert who could build machine learning models is for everybody for example in the previous era when you build machine learning models when you build deep learning models we are working with lot of numerical or categorical features and we have to feed those features into the model. We have to process them, we have to clean them and there are a lot of things involved with that. But now it's just chatting with the model, right? So just say to the model what you need and the model will do it for you. So it's just a conversational experience for you now if you want to use AI. And the other thing is now in previous era when we want to build any AI experience or any AI application we have to train a specific model and we have to go through all these steps like train tune deploy finetune all those stuff and also uh the training will happen I mean sorry the learning process will happen when you're training the model so that's what that was the previous but now it has changed now we have this large lage models which will work for different domains, different uh task. I mean you don't have to fine-tune it. You just have to tell it okay do the text summarization or do the sentiment analysis and it doesn't have to be in the same domain. So you can apply it for different different domains. So that and also they are available as APIs as so the accessibility is very easy now you don't have to train it you can just do a API call and basically access them and other more most important point is they can also learn but I mean of course we can train them somebody has to train them right somebody has already pre-trained them and we can also fine-tune them but another important thing is they can learn during the inference as together. Of course, it's temporarily, but you can feed more information to the prompt and teach these models more information and then get them to do your task. That's a very important capability which wasn't I mean available with previous era of models.""]","Machine learning is more accessible now because AI is for everybody, not just for AI developers or machine learning experts.

What are some of the key limitations of generative AI models?,"[""## [337.84s] Limitations of Generative AI\nYes. So you are like saying generative is great but now let's discuss like what is actually the I mean limitations or what are the uh problems with generative AI. I think one of the main problem I mean I think is the key challenge with generative AI is the hallucination hallucination means this generative mod they can lie to your face and you will believe it if you don't know your facts. So it's it can convince you really well if you don't know the facts you you will believe it. So that how uh good they are at line and that's a big problem. I mean if you look at the examples I mean these are like examples taken from like uh early generation of generative amoras they may not work with current uh state-of-the-art generative amoras but you can I mean it is just to demonstrate like for example if we take the first scenario we asking like who was the first person to walk on the moon and it's just making up facts and saying a different person I mean we all know who was the person walk on the moon for the first time, right? And just making facts, right? And then telling, okay, this was the guy and uh and that that was the only the lunar pioneer mission. And this is a type of hallucination where AI actually I mean the model actually doesn't know the fact. So it's just making it up. And that's okay for these models because these models are not actually any fact generation models. They are content generation model. They are supposed to generate some content, right? they are not supposed to I mean we don't train them to generate the factual correct content that's how they are and the other case is now to overcome these kind of problems we can actually give some context to the model give some context to the prompt and say okay this is the information like for example in this scenario we are telling in early uh October 23rd the war broke between Israel and Hamas and then we ask the model to summarize that and the the sum in the summarization the model is saying it's October 2006 and even we gave the information to the model still it can hallucinate so that's again a problem right and another problem they have is they are not I mean that good with mathematical problems I mean I assume they are good but they are not but again I mean this these things have been fixed and improved a lot with fine-tuning for the current state-of-the-art models and this is again I mean major limitation we had back then and also this is not something we are I mean as integration developers we are not that interested in this problem because we are not going to solve mathematical problems using generative models so I'm just going to uh skip it but keep in mind that's another limitation they have.""]","One of the main limitations of generative AI models is hallucination, where the models can generate incorrect information that appears convincing if the user is not aware of the facts.

How prompt engineering work with examples?,"[""## [649.04s] Example of Prompt Engineering\nSo to take I mean simple example I mean  \nhow the prompt engineering works. So I I  \nthink it's very interesting to look at  \nit for I mean if you look at the future  \nprompting this is one of the basic  \nprompt engineering techniques. So in the  \nuh left hand side we have the zero short  \nprompting approach where we just  \ninstruct the model and say I mean  \nclassify the text into neutral negative  \npositive and then we give the text I  \nthink the vacation is okay and then we  \nask the model to give the sentiment and  \nit say it's neutral I mean that  \nbasically directly telling the model  \nwhat to do but in the future prompting  \nwe have given some examples saying okay  \nthis is awesome and it's a negative  \nthing And this uh bad and it's a  \npositive thing.  \nAnd what's the movie was? Uh  \nyeah, I can't see that in close but you  \ncan see like what we have some stuff  \nright and we have given set of examples  \nto the uh  \nmodel or the LLM and then we have  \nexpected the model when we give the new  \nsample like what's the horrible sh and  \nit will basically give us the correct  \nanswer that that was we have expected.  \nSo we expected model by looking at the  \nexamples  \nyou will give the correct response and  \nwe haven't instruct it at all. I mean we  \nhaven't tell it you are doing a  \nsentiment analysis we haven't told  \nanything and this is a very important  \npattern because let's say now you have  \nthousands of instructions that you have  \nor hundred of introduction instruction  \nthat you need to give to the model to  \nfollow whatever task you want to do.  \nYou can avoid all those things just by  \ngiving set of examples. That's why this  \nis very important and powerful prompt  \nengineering technique""]","Prompt engineering involves instructing a model by providing examples rather than explicit instructions. For instance, in zero-shot prompting, the model is directly told to classify text sentiment as neutral, negative, or positive. In future prompting, examples are given, such as labeling 'this is awesome' as negative and 'this is bad' as positive, allowing the model to learn from these examples and provide the correct response without explicit instructions.

How does integrating external data enhance the functionality of chat GBD-like systems?,"[""# [840.40s] Generative Integration Patterns\nYeah.

What is the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the context of large language models?,"[""# [1253.20s] Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nSo, we talking about like why we  \nshouldn't do that. And now we have the  \nsolution.  \nThe solution is  \nritual augmented generation and that we  \nI mean we may have heard about that  \nthat's the rag that all everybody's  \ntalking about. It's not that we are  \nragging the LM model. It's just a way  \nthat we efficiently use our data on our  \nLLM models.  \nAnd the idea is very simple.  \nDon't put everything to the model  \nprompt. just put just put what is  \nrelevant and what maybe what you seems  \nas relevant  \nof course it's very simple but how to do  \nthat that's the main problem right  \nso what rax suggest is before I mean  \njust putting your data into the prompts  \nfirst you take your data and index your  \ndata for that you can use this vector  \nembeddings and vector DB I will discuss  \nthat concepts so now just think of as we  \nare creating a certain index, a  \nsearch index.  \nAnd when you have the search index, when  \nyou get a question or a task at runtime,  \nwhat you can do is you can look up that  \nindex  \nand then figure out what is what are the  \nthings that are more relevant, right?  \nFor example, when you want to find out  \nsomething, you just Google it, right? So  \nGoogle will use a search index and get  \nyou the links that are relevant to your  \nsearch query similar to that.  \nand then you can feed only that  \ninformation to LLM and get your answers.  \nSo that's what this diagram also  \nexplains.

How are vector embeddings used to determine the similarity between terms like 'cat' and 'kitten' in AI systems?,"[""## [1370.24s] Understanding Vector Embeddings\nSo now to understand this a little bit deep  \nlet's try to understand what is  \na vector embedding.  \nSo vector embedding is a I mean it's a  \nvery simple thing. It's just a numerical  \nrepresentation  \nin a high dimensional space  \nand for your words for your paragraphs  \nfor your sentences. I mean in this case  \nto make it very simple I have used words  \nbut in when you build rags we are not  \nactually doing the web t for the words  \nwe are doing it for uh I mean maybe  \nparagraphs or maybe certain pieces of  \ntext documents you don't have to do it  \nfor each word okay  \nso here if you look at this now I mean I  \nwas telling like it's a high dimensional  \nrepresentation  \nof a given word or a text but I I I  \nthink is better to illustrate with the  \ndiagram what it means. So if you look at  \nthis now we can see like each  \nterm or the word has been represented  \nusing a high I mean three-dimensional  \nvector space and if you look at it you  \ncan see the cat is here and very closer  \nto the class cat we have the kitten. I'm  \nnot sure it's clear it's not clear to me  \nI hope it's clear to you  \nand then we have I mean it's obvious  \nright? So cat and kitten should be  \ncloser because cat is like the baby  \nocean of the kitt. Sorry, kitten is like  \nthe baby version of the cat. And then we  \nhave the dog a little bit closer to the  \ncat but not as much as closer to the  \nkitten because dog is again some I mean  \ndomestic animal that we usually have our  \nin our homes right similar to cats and  \nthen dog has wolf near dog but wolf is  \nfar away from the cat because wolf I  \nmean the connection between the wolf and  \nthe dog is more similar but not as much  \nas the cat and wolf right so you get the  \nidea right so basically what when we do  \nthis representation what happen is  \nwhatever sim similar will be closer in  \nthis high dimensional representation  \nand when we have that what we can do is  \nnow  \nwe can use certain mechanisms like for  \nexample you can I mean if you have taken  \ncertain math uh vector uh  \ncauses you may know like this there's  \ncosine similarity there's equity  \ndistance so there are multiple  \napproaches that you can use to measure  \nthe similarity between two vector  \nvectors and that's what actually vector  \ndatabases are using. So once we have  \nthis representation we can use that  \nvector similarity to figure out what are  \nthe actual uh similar things to whatever  \nthe query that or the question that user  \ngives to the rack  \nand actually this powers the R that  \nmeans ret in the rack and what is a  \nvector database since you know already  \nwhat is a vector embedding it's very  \neasy to understand vector database is a  \ndatabase that can easily represent  \nefficiently represent these vector  \nembeddings in such a way that you can  \nsearch them  \nefficiently faster. So if you have the  \nnormal database you can't do vector  \nsearch with those normal database like  \nrelation databases or document databases  \nyou can't do vector searches but these  \ndatabases they are fine-tuned or they  \nare optimized to do vector searches so  \nthat you can basically get the uh  \nsimilar  \ntext when you are giving a query to the  \nvector database and for I mean popular  \nexamples are pine cone v8 pg vector so  \nthere are bunch of popular uh vector  \ndatabases because this have been uh a  \npopular concept now like my I mean MySQL  \nand other databases.""]","Vector embeddings represent terms in a high-dimensional space, allowing similar terms to be positioned closer together.

So we are trying to do AI transformation and we will discuss like discuss what is AI transformation and also we'll take example and business example and try to use that and say how we can do the AI transformation step by step with that business use case and then Anjen will basically bring in a W integrator to save us all because when we want to implement that in real life we need the toolkit to develop that right so and then we we basically demonstrated and how we do the transformation using W indicator so this going to be the story I I don't want to reveal a lot of stuff that's why I kept it brief in brief but now let's try to understand what is the transformation I mean this is like a I mean this it's not like well adapted term but it's there already and people are discussing about is so the basic idea is now you have a lot of business operations you have lot of things that happening in your organization now can you use AI and enhance those operations so you'll have more productivity more efficiency or a better user experience and also it can be like unlocking new capabilities that wasn't possible before.""]","The W indicator is used to demonstrate and implement AI transformation in real-life business applications.

How has the accessibility of LLMs impacted chatbot development?,"[""## [112.64s] Importance of AI in Transformation\nAnd why AI is important in this scenario because AI is actually uh has become a very powerful tool with the generative AI right so now we can build a lot of stuff that we couldn't build before in previously we couldn't even do a chatbot usually unless we have like a lot of rule based uh or knowledge based kind of systems now building a chatbot is just a matter of like writing a prompt connecting to LLM just have a subscription just need to have like $5 and still you can build a chatbot and try it out you don't even need like a lot of money and why now and that's all because of that because we have a lot of opportunities now the new capabilities are there so you have to basically make use of that and basically uh transform your business with AI otherwise others will do that and you will end up losing the race because there is a race now happening because everybody's trying to use AI so they can transform their business into a better business better uh operation and that's why we need it. It's not a choice of course, right? Because we have to catch up. I mean, even if you don't want to do it, still you'll have to do it to catch up with others otherwise you can't survive.""]","The accessibility of LLMs has significantly impacted chatbot development by making it possible to build chatbots with just a prompt and a subscription, even with minimal financial investment.

Wat is the hotel API used for?,"[""### [253.44s] User Experience Overview\nAnd this is going to be the user experience you have a static web page where you can basically explore and add certain filters and basically get whatever the available hotels and this is going to be the experience right so this is what we we usually have and this is going to be the architecture we are going to have in our business. We have a hotel API, search API, booking API, review API and all these APIs are connecting to our internal databases where we have the hotel database and we have uh booking database which will connected to the booking API and also we have bunch of portals that we expose these capabilities to the customers. For examples, we have the hotel owners who will try to register their hotels. So they will connect to the registration portal and that will go through the hotel API and basically we will have that in our DB then and actually the customers who want to plan their trip book their trip if they want to come and basically do that operation then they have the booking portal they'll use that right so this is actually a business scenario we have already I mean familiar with right so this is what we have right now and this is going to be our system and now we have to think how we can apply a transformation information on top of this existing business APIs and of course we shouldn't forget about the data because data is our strategic asset right that's the asset actually so whatever you have for example you have the booking history of our customers and we have the search behaviors we have their reviews all those things we have already in our hand right so we have to make use of that that's a assist we have and also we have other information like the hotel information trends happening seasonal pattern also some external data maybe the weather events happening all those stuff right so those are also very important information that we can make use of when we are building this kind of I mean I didn't say what's we are going to build but it's going to be useful right if we have to think of how we can make use of this information because we have AI capabilities that can do that now.""]",The hotel API is used to connect to the internal hotel database and facilitate operations such as hotel registration through the registration portal.,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How does the WA application enhance user experience through intelligent trip planning?,"[""## [379.76s] Vision for Transformation\nNow let's discuss like how we can actually do the a transformation information. So before moving to the code, we will try to come with a vision that we want to implement because we we can't just directly jump to the code, right? That's not the process. So we have to come up with a vision where we want to reach. So where we want to reach now with this business is we need to have a intelligent interactive experience that we can give to the users. So they can go and do a trip planning. they can basically say this is my budget, this is what I want and this is going to be my uh basically uh the activities that I'm looking for. So those kind of things they can say to the system and they can get a good uh trip uh plan and then they can basically do the uh reservations or bookings following that plan. So that kind of experience and also we have this strategy data I mentioned them earlier. So we want to make use of them and then basically give a better experience to our customers. For example, if you know about their uh booking patterns or what they like, we can make good sessions to them, right? That's what actually we are doing in our WA application as well. We make use of what you what your interest are and when we are trying to use that to give session sessions so you know which sessions that you can attend in your mobile application.""]","The WA application enhances user experience by providing an intelligent interactive experience for trip planning.

Why we need APIs for AI agents when doing personalization and booking?,"[""## [952.48s] Integration and Personalization\nSo let's think okay can we use a genera  \nintegration here  \nbecause what we said in our previous  \nsession whenever possible you have to  \nuse gena integrations don't go to the  \nagent because agent will introduce a lot  \nof other problems  \nso of course if you give this kind of uh  \nquestion like I want to plan a fiveday  \ntrip Jenna can basically understand the  \nrequest and also generate a useful  \nresponse saying okay great based on your  \npreferences if we have given the  \npreferences  \nThis is what I can recommend and that's  \nbased on whatever the information given  \nto the model or whatever the model knows  \nand that's the all what it can do. It  \ncan't go beyond that. It can't get the  \nhotel availability real time if we  \nhaven't provided that information. I  \nmean we can't give the hotel  \navailability for all the hotel to the  \nprompt right that's not practical. We  \ncan't I mean that general integration  \ncannot actually do actual booking. We  \njust can answer questions but it can't  \ndo that operation and also uh the  \npersonalization across the session won't  \nhappen also because now this gen uh  \nintegration it may have access to what  \nwe have provided as the person session  \ninformation but that's it right it can't  \nremember you the agent can remember you  \nbut this gender integration it can't  \nand that's why we need AI agent for this  \nscenario IO  \nand  \nbecause we have to listen and act  \ndynamically, we also have to connect to  \nbusiness APIs like the booking uh API  \nand also we have to leverage the  \npersonalization. So we have to basically  \nget autonomous uh system right to do  \nthese things. So that's why we need AI  \nagent. I think I don't think like it's  \nvery uh difficult to determine but I  \njust wanted to go through the process so  \nwe can follow that process when you are  \ndesigning I mean designing other  \napplications as well.""]","APIs are needed for AI agents to connect to business services like booking systems and to leverage personalization.

Wht is the hotel polcy asistant and how does it work with the rag component?,"[""## [1855.92s] Building a Hello Agent Application\nUm, yeah. Okay. This is what I ran  \nearlier. I need to stop this.  \nUm,  \nyeah. So, I already have a Yeah. The  \nhello agent, right? Uh, so this is a you  \ncan see the screen there's no it's no  \nissues, right? Yeah. Um,  \nso yeah, this is a empty project  \ncompletely empty project. I haven't done  \nanything, right? So what we want to do  \nis we want to build a hello agent  \napplication right. So all you have to do  \nis you have to go to add artifact right  \nuh just like in any other integration  \ntool you will see like you can make  \ncreate automations HTTP services right  \nuh file integrations event integrations  \neverything but what I'm interested in  \nhere is none of those things right this  \nAI agent part right so if I click that  \nand I say I have to give it a name right  \nI'll just call it creating agent  \num  \nmaybe I'll zoom in a bit. Yeah, sorry.  \nUm,  \nso it's creating the agent.  \nUm, yeah. So, once it's done, you will  \nsee this pretty diagram, right, for the  \nagent that we are building. So, as of  \nnow, this is like very blank. I agree,  \nright? But, um, if you click on this,  \nyou will you can see you can assign a  \nrole to this, right? You can give  \nspecific instruction on what to do,  \nright? And um various things. And if you  \nclick on this icon, you will see you can  \nselect the model provider here. What we  \nhave is the default model provider from  \nWS2. But we can have open athropic  \nanything, right? So the default just to  \nbe clear the default model provider is  \nsomething that we provide. This is this  \nis a service that we provide to get you  \nstarted with uh aava features right so  \nthis is essentially an open air proxy  \nfor now but uh so yeah this is very  \nhelpful when you want to get started  \nwith with the project and maybe debug  \nright so I'm just going to use defaults  \nI don't want to do anything right so um  \nyeah so I need to execute this  \nparticular command to generate the  \ntokens which we require Right. So once  \nthat's out of the way, all we have to do  \nis we can click on this chat icon.  \nRight. So and then you can click run  \ninteg in integration.  \nSo yeah, what this will do is this will  \nrun our application and you will see a  \nsurprise here in a bit. Right? So I'm  \ngoing to Yeah. So now you see right we  \nhave this agent chat window up and  \nrunning in the side. Right. So what we  \ncan say is we we can basically ask  \nsomething right you can say hi right so  \nit'll respond with if I zoom in sorry if  \nI zoom in um  \nuh it replied with hello how can I  \nassist you right so it's this easy for  \nus to create a agent with BI right you  \ndon't have to have any tokens if you if  \nyou're programming this on your own you  \nhave to create rest APIs right uh here  \nthe API is already created um you had to  \ncreate this chat window. You had to have  \nplug it in a front end, right? To check  \nwhether the agent is working as you  \nexpect, right? So the the if you if you  \nhave built agents previously, you will  \nsee how much this helps because when  \nwe're building agents, it's all about um  \niterative development, right? We need to  \nsee okay, okay, we we need to continue a  \nconversation to see where it goes wrong,  \nhow do we refine, right?

So this is where we  \ncan actually say that for an example we  \nhave sample policies like model round  \nrobin model weighted round robin and  \nmodel failover. So uh these cases can be  \nused specifically. So for an example  \nlet's take the model failover policy. So  \nif you use chat GPD even now you can see  \nthat initially you get responses from  \nGPT4 and you get very good responses and  \nvery informative responses but with time  \nwhen you exceed your personal quota you  \nwill be fallen back to the uh GPT4 mini  \nand you get uh uh relatively subpar  \nresponses but um you can actually  \nemulate something like that using the AI  \ngateway to say that okay till this till  \nthe first resource till the uh uh model  \nis exhausted route all the requests to  \nthis endpoint and once that exhausts  \nfall back to this that can be uh error  \nfall back as well. So let's say one uh  \nendpoint for one region fails you can  \nactually fall backward to a different  \nregion and uh we see uh model these  \npolicies like model weighted down domain  \ncome in whereganizations  \nwant to bring in new models. So let's  \nsay open a came up with a new model uh  \nsuddenly and now you want to incorporate  \nthat with your system and you can  \nactually uh uh bring that to the system  \nin a very scaled way to say that  \ninitially route 10% of requests to this  \nnew model and then slowly scale it up so  \nthat actually once everybody's  \ncomfortable with it you can actually  \nmake it 100%. So we have seen use cases  \nlike that happen. Um so going forward we  \nare planning to add more to this. So  \nbasically we are working on this stuff  \nat the moment. So we are planning to add  \nstuff like semantic based routing, LLM  \nbased reasoning routing. So to actually  \nadd an intelligence layer there and  \nactually make decisions in the AI gator  \nto do better model selections depending  \non the prompt.""]","Enterprise architecture plays a crucial role in the deployment of AI agents for intelligent decision-making, particularly in adaptive routing.

However, these stud-\nies primarily concentrate on visual comprehension tasks that\nproduce text-based outputs, such as medical visual ques-\ntion answering (Li et al. 2024a) or report generation (Nath\net al. 2024), and deficient the “drawing” capability needed\nfor medical visual generation. In practice, integrating visual\ncomprehension and generation can significantly enhance the\nmultifunctionality of medical LVLMs.\nRecent studies have increasingly focused on developing\nunified LVLMs capable of comprehending and generating\ncontent across diverse visual modalities. Earlier approaches\npredominantly utilized continuous visual tokens fed into\nLLMs, using the LLMs themselves as conditional genera-\ntors for external generative models (Ge et al. 2024; Wu et al.\n2023; Dong et al. 2023). More recent research has explored\nthe use of discrete visual tokens for image representation and\ngeneration within a fully autoregressive framework (Team\n2024; Wang et al. 2024a; Xie et al. 2024). These meth-\nods not only enhance controllability but also demonstrate\nearly success in open-world, any-to-any tasks, highlighting\nthe preliminary potential of a unified autoregressive learning\nparadigm in multi-modal tasks.\nWhile unified LVLMs have achieved initial success in\ngeneral scenarios, such a unified framework remains under-\nexplored in the medical domain. Adapting the aforemen-\ntioned general unified model paradigm to the medical do-\nmain presents two major challenges: (i) High-scale and\n-quality Data Limitations . Open-world models necessi-\ntate extensive pre-training on billions or even more diverse,\nmulti-modal data samples for comprehension and genera-\ntion tasks (Lu et al. 2024; Team 2024). However, the ac-\ncessible medical data significantly lacks in scale and qual-\nity compared to natural multi-modal datasets. Its special-\nized and domain-specific characteristics make it challenging\nto develop a unified medical model from scratch. (ii) Con-\nflicts between Comprehension and Generation . Compre-\nhension tasks often strip away visual details to focus on\nabstraction, while generation tasks require detailed preser-\nvation, making tokens sensitive to all visual alterations. As\nshown in Figure 2, which features experiments conducted on\nmedical images, the performance in comprehension (or gen-\neration) tasks steadily decreases as the proportion of genera-\ntion (or comprehension) data increases, and vice versa. This\nhighlights a dilemma in autoregressive multi-modal training,\nstemming from the need to maintain consistency between\npre- and post-LVLMs. While some methods have explored\nmutual enhancement between comprehension and genera-\ntion (Pan et al. 2024; Tong et al. 2024), improvements still\nexhibit diminishing returns, with performance degradation\nremaining a significant issue.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2: With a fixed amount of comprehension (genera-\ntion) data, increasing the proportion of the other type leads\nto significant performance degradation.\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose\nHealthGPT (see Figure 1) , which progressively adapts a\npre-trained LLM as an unified medical multi-modal model\nwith a small amount of visual instruction data. We de-\nvise innovative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) ap-\nproach (Ding et al. 2023), calledHeterogeneous Low-Rank\nAdaptation (H-LoRA), which decouples the learning pro-\ncess of LVLMs for comprehension and generation tasks. In-\nspired by the plug-and-play nature of LoRA (Hu et al. 2021),\nH-LoRA enables the model to store heterogeneous compre-\nhension and generation knowledge in independent “plug-\nins”, thus avoiding joint optimization issues caused by con-\nflicts between comprehension and generation tasks. In addi-\ntion, we also consider the variety of sub-tasks among com-\nprehension or generation tasks. Qualitative research high-\nlights the limitations of a single LoRA in handling multi-\ndimensional task scenarios, mainly due to catastrophic for-\ngetting and interference (Liu et al. 2024d; Lin et al. 2024).\nTo address this, we draw on the concept of Mixture of Ex-\nperts (MoE) (Masoudnia and Ebrahimpour 2014) and in-\ntroduce LoRA experts. The aim is to dynamically transfer\ntask-shared knowledge to adapt to downstream tasks. Unlike\nMoELoRA (Luo et al. 2024a), H-LoRA employs reversible\nmatrix block multiplication to combine LoRA experts, sig-\nnificantly reducing the overhead of multiple matrix multi-\nplications. Notably, when using four experts, it requires\nonly 67% of the MoELoRA training time.\nTo effectively leverage H-LoRA inHealthGPT, we fur-\nther introduce a Hierarchical Visual Perception (HVP)\nand devise a correspondingThree-stage Learning Strategy\n(TLS). HVP: we separate visual details learning from Vi-\nsion transformer (ViT) for comprehension and generation.\nAs is widely recognized, the ViT encodes visual concepts\nwith increasing abstraction, generally, becoming finer as we\nprogress over levels (Vig 2019). Thus, we maintain the vi-\nsual features of the anterior and posterior layers to accom-\nmodate the differing requirements for visual granularity in\ncomprehension and generation tasks while preventing po-\n2']","Enterprise architecture plays a crucial role in the implementation of token management and the use of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in AI systems.

So it's it can convince you really well if you don't know the facts you you will believe it. So that how uh good they are at line and that's a big problem. I mean if you look at the examples I mean these are like examples taken from like uh early generation of generative amoras they may not work with current uh state-of-the-art generative amoras but you can I mean it is just to demonstrate like for example if we take the first scenario we asking like who was the first person to walk on the moon and it's just making up facts and saying a different person I mean we all know who was the person walk on the moon for the first time, right? And just making facts, right? And then telling, okay, this was the guy and uh and that that was the only the lunar pioneer mission. And this is a type of hallucination where AI actually I mean the model actually doesn't know the fact. So it's just making it up. And that's okay for these models because these models are not actually any fact generation models. They are content generation model. They are supposed to generate some content, right? they are not supposed to I mean we don't train them to generate the factual correct content that's how they are and the other case is now to overcome these kind of problems we can actually give some context to the model give some context to the prompt and say okay this is the information like for example in this scenario we are telling in early uh October 23rd the war broke between Israel and Hamas and then we ask the model to summarize that and the the sum in the summarization the model is saying it's October 2006 and even we gave the information to the model still it can hallucinate so that's again a problem right and another problem they have is they are not I mean that good with mathematical problems I mean I assume they are good but they are not but again I mean this these things have been fixed and improved a lot with fine-tuning for the current state-of-the-art models and this is again I mean major limitation we had back then and also this is not something we are I mean as integration developers we are not that interested in this problem because we are not going to solve mathematical problems using generative models so I'm just going to uh skip it but keep in mind that's another limitation they have."", ""<3-hop>\n\n## [147.12s] Rana Kloff - Chief AI Officer at WSO2\n>> Hello everyone.

I think the the challenge is  \nchange management. So I think the  \ntechnology is moving fast. I think the  \ntechnology is actually well ahead of  \nwhat organizations can actually consume.  \nUm at this point I think the actual the  \nbig important thing for us is think  \nabout the change management. So think  \nabout the people think about the  \nprocesses you know bringing colleagues  \nalong on this journey particularly those  \nthat are going to get impacted uh from  \nAI I think is is a real real challenge.  \nSo I think that's where there's going to  \nbe a lot of focus and resources going  \nforward as to how to um you know how to  \nmanage that and there's there's  \ngenerally kind of two ways to do it. One  \nway you can just push it into the  \nexisting organization. The other way is  \nyou can create a new organization on the  \nside um and then sort of just lift and  \nshift customers over to that as well as  \nalso um you know colleagues and  \nprofessionals and there's probably a  \nhybrid uh version as well. But you know  \nI think uh you know certainly we we see  \nin our space there's um there's a lot of  \nfocus on the tech which is good but  \nsometimes the change management um is  \nnot really thought about too much which  \ncan be frustrating when you build great  \ntech and then you know it's not um it's  \nnot accepted. I think there was a  \nstatistic last year and that's something  \nlike 15%  \nof successful PC's actually made their  \nway into production. successful PC's  \nthey actually work fine but they're  \nrejected by the organization at 80% plus  \nof the uh of the the time. So people and  \nprocesses don't forget that one"", ""<3-hop>\n\n## [922.00s] Staff Allocation Agent\nAnd then  \nthere's a different agent which is a  \nstaff allocation agent who is uh working  \nbehind in the background. So it will get  \ntriggered based on uh when when someone  \nis made make a booking and then it will  \ngo through the user's personal profile  \nand allocate someone from the staff for  \nthat particular booking instance. Let's  \nlook at where we want to add different  \ndifferent uh security boundaries in this  \nagentic uh when you are introducing  \nagentic AI into this platform. So  \none thing is this user and the agent and  \nthat component where the u user  \ninteracts with the uh system and then  \nfrom there there are different lines  \ngoing into the backend system and  \nthere's another boundary where these uh  \nbackend systems are there and these uh  \nthis backend system may call different  \nother parties as well.

For instance, in the context of the rack pattern, enterprise architecture dictates whether documents are uploaded in bulk or through more sophisticated environments like FTP servers, which can trigger specific pipelines. However, the successful implementation of these systems is often challenged by change management issues. As technology advances rapidly, organizations struggle to keep pace, leading to a focus on managing people and processes to ensure new technologies are accepted and utilized effectively. This involves strategies such as integrating new systems into existing organizations or creating separate entities to manage transitions, highlighting the importance of considering both technical and human factors in enterprise architecture.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

I'll start with a very recent example. So if you have heard of this uh replet use case, repleit is a software engineering assistant platform where they employ sort of agents and AI to write software and there was a recent incident where this uh agent deleted an entire data production database despite it was asked not to in the system prompt. That's where the importance comes because if we don't do proper access controls and entitlement management around these agents, they could do things that you don't expect them to. So it's very important that you to make sure that they work within the limits they are supposed to work and just not just uh instructing them but also enforcing these the rules and policies and access control level layers on top of these agents and uh most importantly the traditional software was more of predictable and uh traditional IM also designed for that uh where the application logic is predefined and it'll will act the way it was supposed to."", '<3-hop>\n\nSpecifically, recent studies (Li et al. 2024a; Tu et al. 2024)\nhave utilized pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and\nvisual instruction data to build interactive diagnostic tools\nand treatment planning systems, revealing the immense po-\ntential of LVLMs in medical scenarios. However, these stud-\nies primarily concentrate on visual comprehension tasks that\nproduce text-based outputs, such as medical visual ques-\ntion answering (Li et al. 2024a) or report generation (Nath\net al. 2024), and deficient the “drawing” capability needed\nfor medical visual generation. In practice, integrating visual\ncomprehension and generation can significantly enhance the\nmultifunctionality of medical LVLMs.\nRecent studies have increasingly focused on developing\nunified LVLMs capable of comprehending and generating\ncontent across diverse visual modalities. Earlier approaches\npredominantly utilized continuous visual tokens fed into\nLLMs, using the LLMs themselves as conditional genera-\ntors for external generative models (Ge et al. 2024; Wu et al.\n2023; Dong et al. 2023). More recent research has explored\nthe use of discrete visual tokens for image representation and\ngeneration within a fully autoregressive framework (Team\n2024; Wang et al. 2024a; Xie et al. 2024). These meth-\nods not only enhance controllability but also demonstrate\nearly success in open-world, any-to-any tasks, highlighting\nthe preliminary potential of a unified autoregressive learning\nparadigm in multi-modal tasks.\nWhile unified LVLMs have achieved initial success in\ngeneral scenarios, such a unified framework remains under-\nexplored in the medical domain. Adapting the aforemen-\ntioned general unified model paradigm to the medical do-\nmain presents two major challenges: (i) High-scale and\n-quality Data Limitations . Open-world models necessi-\ntate extensive pre-training on billions or even more diverse,\nmulti-modal data samples for comprehension and genera-\ntion tasks (Lu et al. 2024; Team 2024). However, the ac-\ncessible medical data significantly lacks in scale and qual-\nity compared to natural multi-modal datasets. Its special-\nized and domain-specific characteristics make it challenging\nto develop a unified medical model from scratch. (ii) Con-\nflicts between Comprehension and Generation . Compre-\nhension tasks often strip away visual details to focus on\nabstraction, while generation tasks require detailed preser-\nvation, making tokens sensitive to all visual alterations. As\nshown in Figure 2, which features experiments conducted on\nmedical images, the performance in comprehension (or gen-\neration) tasks steadily decreases as the proportion of genera-\ntion (or comprehension) data increases, and vice versa. This\nhighlights a dilemma in autoregressive multi-modal training,\nstemming from the need to maintain consistency between\npre- and post-LVLMs. While some methods have explored\nmutual enhancement between comprehension and genera-\ntion (Pan et al. 2024; Tong et al. 2024), improvements still\nexhibit diminishing returns, with performance degradation\nremaining a significant issue.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2: With a fixed amount of comprehension (genera-\ntion) data, increasing the proportion of the other type leads\nto significant performance degradation.\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose\nHealthGPT (see Figure 1) , which progressively adapts a\npre-trained LLM as an unified medical multi-modal model\nwith a small amount of visual instruction data. We de-\nvise innovative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) ap-\nproach (Ding et al. 2023), calledHeterogeneous Low-Rank\nAdaptation (H-LoRA), which decouples the learning pro-\ncess of LVLMs for comprehension and generation tasks. In-\nspired by the plug-and-play nature of LoRA (Hu et al. 2021),\nH-LoRA enables the model to store heterogeneous compre-\nhension and generation knowledge in independent “plug-\nins”, thus avoiding joint optimization issues caused by con-\nflicts between comprehension and generation tasks. In addi-\ntion, we also consider the variety of sub-tasks among com-\nprehension or generation tasks. Qualitative research high-\nlights the limitations of a single LoRA in handling multi-\ndimensional task scenarios, mainly due to catastrophic for-\ngetting and interference (Liu et al. 2024d; Lin et al. 2024).\nTo address this, we draw on the concept of Mixture of Ex-\nperts (MoE) (Masoudnia and Ebrahimpour 2014) and in-\ntroduce LoRA experts. The aim is to dynamically transfer\ntask-shared knowledge to adapt to downstream tasks. Unlike\nMoELoRA (Luo et al. 2024a), H-LoRA employs reversible\nmatrix block multiplication to combine LoRA experts, sig-\nnificantly reducing the overhead of multiple matrix multi-\nplications. Notably, when using four experts, it requires\nonly 67% of the MoELoRA training time.\nTo effectively leverage H-LoRA inHealthGPT, we fur-\nther introduce a Hierarchical Visual Perception (HVP)\nand devise a correspondingThree-stage Learning Strategy\n(TLS). HVP: we separate visual details learning from Vi-\nsion transformer (ViT) for comprehension and generation.\nAs is widely recognized, the ViT encodes visual concepts\nwith increasing abstraction, generally, becoming finer as we\nprogress over levels (Vig 2019). Thus, we maintain the vi-\nsual features of the anterior and posterior layers to accom-\nmodate the differing requirements for visual granularity in\ncomprehension and generation tasks while preventing po-\n2']","Enterprise architecture significantly influences the integration of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in AI systems by determining how data and resources are managed and accessed.

This integration strategy is essential for building AI applications tailored to enterprise use cases, as it allows for the seamless incorporation of AI capabilities into existing workflows. Additionally, the cost of computation in AI applications is influenced by the choice between using cloud-based AI models and developing in-house models. While cloud-based models offer accessibility and ease of integration, they can lead to high monthly costs if used extensively. In contrast, developing in-house models may require significant upfront investment in infrastructure but can be more cost-effective in the long run, especially if the computational needs are high.

(iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks.

So let's say one uh  \nendpoint for one region fails you can  \nactually fall backward to a different  \nregion and uh we see uh model these  \npolicies like model weighted down domain  \ncome in whereganizations  \nwant to bring in new models. So let's  \nsay open a came up with a new model uh  \nsuddenly and now you want to incorporate  \nthat with your system and you can  \nactually uh uh bring that to the system  \nin a very scaled way to say that  \ninitially route 10% of requests to this  \nnew model and then slowly scale it up so  \nthat actually once everybody's  \ncomfortable with it you can actually  \nmake it 100%. So we have seen use cases  \nlike that happen. Um so going forward we  \nare planning to add more to this. So  \nbasically we are working on this stuff  \nat the moment. So we are planning to add  \nstuff like semantic based routing, LLM  \nbased reasoning routing. So to actually  \nadd an intelligence layer there and  \nactually make decisions in the AI gator  \nto do better model selections depending  \non the prompt.""]","The adaptive routing in AI systems handles situations when GPT4 is not available by implementing a model failover policy. Initially, responses are provided by GPT4, but when the personal quota is exceeded, the system falls back to GPT4 mini, resulting in relatively subpar responses. This approach allows for error fallback, where if one endpoint fails, requests can be rerouted to a different region. Additionally, adaptive routing can incorporate new models by initially routing a small percentage of requests to the new model and gradually increasing it as the system becomes more comfortable with the new model.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

We curate VL-Health dataset (see Fig-\nure 4). For medical visual comprehension, we leverage\nmultiple medical-specific datasets, including PubMedVi-\nsion (Chen et al. 2024a), LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b),\nPathVQA (He et al. 2020), MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), and VQA-RAD (Lau\net al. 2018). Additionally, we incorporate high-quality open-\nworld data from LLaV A-1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b) to preserve\nthe model’s general knowledge and instruction-following\ncapabilities. For generation tasks, we construct a recon-\nstruction dataset based on LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b),\nand also explore two key tasks in personalized medical\nimage enhancement—super-resolution and modality con-\nversion—using the IXI (Davies et al. 2014) and Syn-\nthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) datasets. Detailed data\nselection and instruction templates are in the Appendix.\nModel Details. We select CLIP-L/14 (Radford et al. 2021)\nas the visual encoder and used the hidden states of its\nsecond and penultimate layers as concrete-grained and\nabstract-grained features for model’s dynamic hierarchical\nvisual perception. Drawing on the successful experiences of\nLLaV A, we employ a MLP to align the multi-modal fea-\nture embeddings. We choose the parameter-efficient phi-3-\nmini (Abdin et al. 2024) and phi-4 (Abdin et al. 2024) as the\nbase model. For visual comprehension and generation tasks,\nwe set the rank of H-LoRA to 16 and 64, with four experts.\nAdditionally, we use the f8-8192 version of VQGAN as the\nimage indexing and upsampling module.\n5.2 Main Experiments\nComprehension. We compare HealthGPT with several\nexisting models, including medical-specific LVLMs (e.g.,\nMed-Flamingo (Moor et al. 2023), LLaV A-Med (Li et al.\n2024b), HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)) as well\nas recent open-world LVLMs (e.g., BLIP-2 (Li et al.\n2023b), LLaV A-v1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b), InstructBLIP (Dai\net al. 2023), Yi-VL (Young et al. 2024), InternVL2 (Chen\n6']","HealthGPT, particularly the HealthGPT-L14 model, outperforms other LVLMs in medical visual comprehension tasks.

"How does LLaV A-Med enhance visual-text alignment in medical contexts, and what are its implications for the adaptability of medical vision-language models?","['<1-hop>\n\ntential task interference. TLS: In the first and second stages,\ngiven the heterogeneity between comprehension and gener-\nation tasks, we first train H-LoRA plugins for HealthGPT\nto incorporate both medical comprehension and generation\nknowledge, thus endowing the LLMs with capabilities for\nvision-language alignment and vision-to-vision reconstruc-\ntion. Additionally, through minimal mixed-task training, we\nbuilt fusion embedding layers and output heads that merge\ntext and visual tokens, establishing a unified LVLM founda-\ntion for visual instruction fine-tuning. In the third stage, by\nonly training the H-LoRA plugins, HealthGPT is able to\nrapidly adapt to a wide range of downstream medical tasks,\ncovering various types of medical comprehension and gen-\neration tasks.\nTo effectively implement our approach, we have cu-\nrated a dataset for training unified medical LVLMs, called\nVL-Health, including seven comprehension tasks and five\ngeneration tasks (Figure 1). Through quantitative analysis\nand validation on multi-modal tasks, the results demonstrate\nthat HealthGPT is capable of unifying medical multi-\nmodal abilities in data-constrained scenarios, achieving per-\nformance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-\nart (SOTA) models across multiple metrics. Overall, the\nmain contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n• Unified Med-LVLM. We introduce HealthGPT,\nwhich, to the best of our knowledge, is the first unified\nframework for multi-modal comprehension and genera-\ntion in complex medical scenarios.\n• Effective Learning Paradigm. We present H-LoRA, an\noptimized multi-LoRA PEFT architecture based on task-\ngated decoupling, is designed to effectively mitigate data\nconflict issues.\n• Holistic Training Dataset. We curated VL-Health, a\ncomprehensive dataset designed for both comprehension\nand generation tasks.\n• Superior Downstream Improvements : Extensive ex-\nperiments are conducted and the results confirm\nHealthGPT’s effectiveness in medical vision-language\ncomprehension and generation.\n2 Related Work\nMedical Vision Large Language Models. Recently, medi-\ncal vision large language models (Med-VLLMs) have made\nsignificant progress, demonstrating excellent performance\nin understanding medical images and responding to human\nqueries based on these images (Zhou et al. 2023; Tian et al.\n2023). XrayGPT (Thawkar et al. 2023) combines a med-\nical visual encoder (MedClip) (Wang et al. 2022) with a\nfine-tuned LLM , using a simple linear transformation layer\nto achieve alignment between visual and textual informa-\ntion, significantly enhancing the understanding of medical\nimages. On this basis, LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) fur-\nther enhances visual-text alignment in medical contexts by\nselecting high-quality image-text pairs from PubMed pa-\npers and synthesized VQA datasets. BiomedGPT (Luo et al.\n2024b) employs a BERT-style encoder and GPT-style de-\ncoder architecture, pre-trained on interdisciplinary datasets.\nCompared to commercial models like Med-PaLM (Singhal\net al. 2023), BiomedGPT significantly reduces model size\nwhile maintaining superior performance. However, issues\nof language adaptability and dataset specificity still remain.\nTo address these, HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)\nintroduces the PubMedVision dataset, which contains 1.3\nmillion high-quality medical samples, significantly improv-\ning the model’s adaptability across diverse medical applica-\ntions. However, current Med-VLLMs mainly focus on med-\nical comprehension and lack the capability for the medical\nvision-language generation.\nUnified Visual Comprehension and Generation Mod-\nels. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on cre-\nating unified LVLMs that are adept at understanding and\nproducing content across various visual modalities. NExT-\nGPT (Wu et al. 2023) achieves perception and generation for\narbitrary combinations of multi-modal inputs and outputs by\naligning LLMs. Similarly, SEED (Ge et al. 2023), SEED-\nX (Ge et al. 2024), and DreamLLM (Dong et al. 2023) em-\nploy learnable queries and leverage next-token prediction to\ngenerate visual tokens, providing conditional inputs to exter-\nnal generation modules. Unlike these methods, which func-\ntion as external conditioners, Unified-IO (Lu et al. 2022),\nUnified-IO 2 (Lu et al. 2024), and Chameleon (Team 2024)\ninternalize multi-modal generation tasks within a unified\nTransformer architecture by extending multi-modal vocab-\nularies, enabling direct generation based on next-token pre-\ndiction. Building on this concept, Lumina-mGPT (Liu et al.\n2024a) and ANOLE (Chern et al. 2024) further enhance the\ngeneration capabilities of unified models using high-quality\ndata, particularly improving the quality and flexibility of im-\nage generation.\n3 Preliminaries\nLarge Vision-Language Models.The input to a LVLM typ-\nically consists of an image ximg and a discrete text sequence\nxtxt. The visual encoder Eimg converts the input image ximg\ninto a sequence of visual tokens V = [ vi]Nv\ni=1, while the\ntext sequence xtxt is mapped into a sequence of text to-\nkens T = [ ti]Nt\ni=1 using an embedding function Etxt. The\nLLM MLLM(·|θ) models the joint probability of the token\nsequence U = {V, T }, which is expressed as:\nPθ(R|U) =\nNrY\ni=1\nPθ(ri|{U, r<i}), (1)\nwhere R = [ri]Nr\ni=1 is the text response sequence. The LVLM\niteratively generates the next token ri based on r<i. The op-\ntimization objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss of\nthe response R.

Addition-\nally, we test several SOTA unified visual comprehension\nand generation models, including Show-o (Xie et al. 2024),\nUnified-IO 2 (Lu et al. 2024), and Janus (Wu et al.\n2024). The experimental results are shown in Table 1, with\nthe following key observations: (i) SOTA Results Com-\npared with LVLMs: In medical visual comprehension\ntasks, HealthGPT demonstrates superior performance,\nsignificantly outperforming both medical-specific models\n(e.g., HuatuoGPT-Vision) and general-purpose models (e.g.,\nLlama-3.2). (ii) Surpassing Current Unified LVLMs: De-\nspite being trained on billions of data points, unified mod-\nels still exhibit poor generalization performance in medi-\ncal visual comprehension. For instance, Unified-IO 2 scored\nonly 33.8. In contrast,HealthGPT-M3, with only 3.8B pa-\nrameters, scored 61.3 on the medical multi-modal unified\ntask, significantly outperforming existing unified models in\nmedical downstream scenarios.

This result signif-\nicantly outperforms all other models, highlighting the effec-\ntiveness of scaling up the base model for enhanced perfor-\nmance in medical tasks.\nGeneration. We study three key tasks in medical imag-\ning. (i) Modality Conversion: In this task, we focus on\nthe conversion between CT and MRI modalities for the\nbrain and pelvic regions, designing four specific sub-tasks.\nAll comparative models (Pix2Pix (Isola et al. 2017), Cy-\ncleGAN (Zhu et al. 2017), BBDM (Li et al. 2023a),\n(%)\n(%)\n（a） （b）\nFigure 6: The loss visualization (a) and performance com-\nparison (b) with respect to different visual perceptions.\nVmamba (Liu et al. 2024e), and DiffMa (Wang et al.\n2024b)) trained a separate model for each sub-task, while\nHealthGPT unify all tasks into a single training process.\nThe experimental results, shown in Table 11, demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms other methods across multi-\nple evaluation metrics. For instance, in the CT2MRI-Brain\ntask, HealthGPT-M3 achieves an SSIM of 79.38, signif-\nicantly surpassing traditional methods like Pix2Pix (71.09)\nand the recent DiffMa (71.47). (ii) Super-Resolution: We\nconduct 4× super-resolution experiments on the IXI dataset,\nwith the results presented in Table 3. Notably, most exist-\ning methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge of key\nstructures in medical images, resulting in significant short-\ncomings in detail recovery. In contrast, our method signif-\nicantly mitigates this issue. Specifically, HealthGPT-M3\nexcels in key metrics such as SSIM, PSNR, and ISE, achiev-\ning scores of 78.19, 32.76, and 34.47, respectively. Ad-\nditionally, HealthGPT-M3 achieves the lowest score of\n12.34, further validating its exceptional performance in hu-\nman visual perception. (iii) Reconstruction: We compare\nHealthGPT-M3 with unified models with reconstruction\ncapabilities, such as Unified-IO 2 and SEED-X. The results\nshow that our approach performs better controllability for vi-\nsual reconstruction. We also trainHealthGPT-L14 with a\nsimilar number of trainable parameters to the M3 version.\nHence, the similar performance between the two models\nmeets our expectations. Details are in the Appendix.\n5.3 In-Depth Study\nEffect of Heterogeneous Low-Rank Adaptation.H-LoRA\nprovides an optimized multi-LoRA architecture for multi-\ntask learning. We conduct extensive validation of this struc-\nture, with results presented in Table 4, comparing the per-\nformance of LoRA, MoELoRA, and H-LoRA in medical\nunified comprehension and generation tasks. In the majority\nof comprehension tasks and all generation tasks, H-LoRA\ndemonstrates superior performance, particularly in the Om-\nniMedVQA benchmark, where it improved from 64.90 to\n68.50.

(iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks. We will\nfurther demonstrate the significant advantage of H-LoRA in training time in subsequent experiments, validating its efficiency\nin practical applications.\nC Supplemental Experimental Results\nIn this section, we include additional experiments to demonstrate the superiority of HealthGPT and articulate our design\nphilosophy.\nC.1 Results: OmniMedVQA Benchmark\nOmniMedVQA (Hu et al. 2024) is a novel, large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to\nencompass various modalities and anatomical regions by collecting diverse images from multiple medical datasets.

"How does LLaV A-Med perform on the OmniMedVQA benchmark compared to other models, and what are the computational advantages of H-LoRA over MoELoRA?","['<1-hop>\n\nexpansion operations on the Router’s output weights to generate the appropriate shapes that match the dimensions of the in-\nput and LoRA experts while iterating through the experts. (iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks. We will\nfurther demonstrate the significant advantage of H-LoRA in training time in subsequent experiments, validating its efficiency\nin practical applications.\nC Supplemental Experimental Results\nIn this section, we include additional experiments to demonstrate the superiority of HealthGPT and articulate our design\nphilosophy.\nC.1 Results: OmniMedVQA Benchmark\nOmniMedVQA (Hu et al. 2024) is a novel, large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to\nencompass various modalities and anatomical regions by collecting diverse images from multiple medical datasets.

So, next we get  \nto the adaptive routing part. So, this  \nis uh basically  \ncases where we can actually make  \nbetter decisions about the models  \ninvoked and the providers invoked from  \nthe AI gate level. So this is where we  \ncan actually say that for an example we  \nhave sample policies like model round  \nrobin model weighted round robin and  \nmodel failover. So uh these cases can be  \nused specifically. So for an example  \nlet's take the model failover policy. So  \nif you use chat GPD even now you can see  \nthat initially you get responses from  \nGPT4 and you get very good responses and  \nvery informative responses but with time  \nwhen you exceed your personal quota you  \nwill be fallen back to the uh GPT4 mini  \nand you get uh uh relatively subpar  \nresponses but um you can actually  \nemulate something like that using the AI  \ngateway to say that okay till this till  \nthe first resource till the uh uh model  \nis exhausted route all the requests to  \nthis endpoint and once that exhausts  \nfall back to this that can be uh error  \nfall back as well.

This ensures continuous service even if one endpoint fails. Additionally, the AI gateway can gradually introduce new models by initially routing a small percentage of requests to them and scaling up as confidence in the model grows.

We curate VL-Health dataset (see Fig-\nure 4). For medical visual comprehension, we leverage\nmultiple medical-specific datasets, including PubMedVi-\nsion (Chen et al. 2024a), LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b),\nPathVQA (He et al. 2020), MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), and VQA-RAD (Lau\net al. 2018). Additionally, we incorporate high-quality open-\nworld data from LLaV A-1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b) to preserve\nthe model’s general knowledge and instruction-following\ncapabilities. For generation tasks, we construct a recon-\nstruction dataset based on LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b),\nand also explore two key tasks in personalized medical\nimage enhancement—super-resolution and modality con-\nversion—using the IXI (Davies et al. 2014) and Syn-\nthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) datasets. Detailed data\nselection and instruction templates are in the Appendix.\nModel Details. We select CLIP-L/14 (Radford et al. 2021)\nas the visual encoder and used the hidden states of its\nsecond and penultimate layers as concrete-grained and\nabstract-grained features for model’s dynamic hierarchical\nvisual perception. Drawing on the successful experiences of\nLLaV A, we employ a MLP to align the multi-modal fea-\nture embeddings. We choose the parameter-efficient phi-3-\nmini (Abdin et al. 2024) and phi-4 (Abdin et al. 2024) as the\nbase model. For visual comprehension and generation tasks,\nwe set the rank of H-LoRA to 16 and 64, with four experts.\nAdditionally, we use the f8-8192 version of VQGAN as the\nimage indexing and upsampling module.\n5.2 Main Experiments\nComprehension. We compare HealthGPT with several\nexisting models, including medical-specific LVLMs (e.g.,\nMed-Flamingo (Moor et al. 2023), LLaV A-Med (Li et al.\n2024b), HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)) as well\nas recent open-world LVLMs (e.g., BLIP-2 (Li et al.\n2023b), LLaV A-v1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b), InstructBLIP (Dai\net al. 2023), Yi-VL (Young et al. 2024), InternVL2 (Chen\n6', '<2-hop>\n\nSpecifically, recent studies (Li et al. 2024a; Tu et al. 2024)\nhave utilized pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and\nvisual instruction data to build interactive diagnostic tools\nand treatment planning systems, revealing the immense po-\ntential of LVLMs in medical scenarios. However, these stud-\nies primarily concentrate on visual comprehension tasks that\nproduce text-based outputs, such as medical visual ques-\ntion answering (Li et al. 2024a) or report generation (Nath\net al. 2024), and deficient the “drawing” capability needed\nfor medical visual generation. In practice, integrating visual\ncomprehension and generation can significantly enhance the\nmultifunctionality of medical LVLMs.\nRecent studies have increasingly focused on developing\nunified LVLMs capable of comprehending and generating\ncontent across diverse visual modalities. Earlier approaches\npredominantly utilized continuous visual tokens fed into\nLLMs, using the LLMs themselves as conditional genera-\ntors for external generative models (Ge et al. 2024; Wu et al.\n2023; Dong et al. 2023). More recent research has explored\nthe use of discrete visual tokens for image representation and\ngeneration within a fully autoregressive framework (Team\n2024; Wang et al. 2024a; Xie et al. 2024). These meth-\nods not only enhance controllability but also demonstrate\nearly success in open-world, any-to-any tasks, highlighting\nthe preliminary potential of a unified autoregressive learning\nparadigm in multi-modal tasks.\nWhile unified LVLMs have achieved initial success in\ngeneral scenarios, such a unified framework remains under-\nexplored in the medical domain. Adapting the aforemen-\ntioned general unified model paradigm to the medical do-\nmain presents two major challenges: (i) High-scale and\n-quality Data Limitations . Open-world models necessi-\ntate extensive pre-training on billions or even more diverse,\nmulti-modal data samples for comprehension and genera-\ntion tasks (Lu et al. 2024; Team 2024). However, the ac-\ncessible medical data significantly lacks in scale and qual-\nity compared to natural multi-modal datasets. Its special-\nized and domain-specific characteristics make it challenging\nto develop a unified medical model from scratch. (ii) Con-\nflicts between Comprehension and Generation . Compre-\nhension tasks often strip away visual details to focus on\nabstraction, while generation tasks require detailed preser-\nvation, making tokens sensitive to all visual alterations. As\nshown in Figure 2, which features experiments conducted on\nmedical images, the performance in comprehension (or gen-\neration) tasks steadily decreases as the proportion of genera-\ntion (or comprehension) data increases, and vice versa. This\nhighlights a dilemma in autoregressive multi-modal training,\nstemming from the need to maintain consistency between\npre- and post-LVLMs. While some methods have explored\nmutual enhancement between comprehension and genera-\ntion (Pan et al. 2024; Tong et al. 2024), improvements still\nexhibit diminishing returns, with performance degradation\nremaining a significant issue.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2: With a fixed amount of comprehension (genera-\ntion) data, increasing the proportion of the other type leads\nto significant performance degradation.\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose\nHealthGPT (see Figure 1) , which progressively adapts a\npre-trained LLM as an unified medical multi-modal model\nwith a small amount of visual instruction data. We de-\nvise innovative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) ap-\nproach (Ding et al. 2023), calledHeterogeneous Low-Rank\nAdaptation (H-LoRA), which decouples the learning pro-\ncess of LVLMs for comprehension and generation tasks. In-\nspired by the plug-and-play nature of LoRA (Hu et al. 2021),\nH-LoRA enables the model to store heterogeneous compre-\nhension and generation knowledge in independent “plug-\nins”, thus avoiding joint optimization issues caused by con-\nflicts between comprehension and generation tasks. In addi-\ntion, we also consider the variety of sub-tasks among com-\nprehension or generation tasks. Qualitative research high-\nlights the limitations of a single LoRA in handling multi-\ndimensional task scenarios, mainly due to catastrophic for-\ngetting and interference (Liu et al. 2024d; Lin et al. 2024).\nTo address this, we draw on the concept of Mixture of Ex-\nperts (MoE) (Masoudnia and Ebrahimpour 2014) and in-\ntroduce LoRA experts. The aim is to dynamically transfer\ntask-shared knowledge to adapt to downstream tasks. Unlike\nMoELoRA (Luo et al. 2024a), H-LoRA employs reversible\nmatrix block multiplication to combine LoRA experts, sig-\nnificantly reducing the overhead of multiple matrix multi-\nplications. Notably, when using four experts, it requires\nonly 67% of the MoELoRA training time.\nTo effectively leverage H-LoRA inHealthGPT, we fur-\nther introduce a Hierarchical Visual Perception (HVP)\nand devise a correspondingThree-stage Learning Strategy\n(TLS). HVP: we separate visual details learning from Vi-\nsion transformer (ViT) for comprehension and generation.\nAs is widely recognized, the ViT encodes visual concepts\nwith increasing abstraction, generally, becoming finer as we\nprogress over levels (Vig 2019).

The challenges addressed include the high-scale and quality data limitations in the medical domain and the conflicts between comprehension and generation tasks, where comprehension often strips away visual details while generation requires detailed preservation.

"How does the LLaV A-Med dataset contribute to the development of unified medical vision-language models like HealthGPT, and what role does H-LoRA play in enhancing these models for multi-modal medical applications?","['<1-hop>\n\n（a） （b）\nFigure 8: VL-Health dataset collection distribution.\nA.3 VL-Health\nThe construction of theVL-Health dataset involves two key steps:(i) data collection, (ii) data processing, as detailed below:\nData Collection: During the collection phase, we carefully considered the diversity of medical images and the complexity of\nthe tasks, selecting appropriate subsets for comprehension and generation tasks. For comprehension tasks, we selected datasets\nsuch as VQA-RAD (Lau et al. 2018), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), PathVQA (He et al. 2020), and MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), which cover various medical imaging modalities like radiology and pathology, and include professional annotations\nto assist the model in learning tasks such as lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Additionally, large-scale multi-modal\ndatasets like LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) and PubMedVision (Chen et al. 2024a) were included to provide broader medical\nknowledge support and facilitate the training of complex reasoning tasks. For generation tasks, we focused on four mainstream\ntask categories: super-resolution image generation, modality conversion, text-to-image generation, and image reconstruction.\nThe IXI (Davies et al. 2014) dataset, containing a large number of healthy brain MRI images, is suitable for training super-\nresolution models; the MIMIC-CHEST-XRAY (Bae et al. 2024) dataset, with X-ray images and their corresponding textual\nreports, is appropriate for text-to-image generation tasks; the SynthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) dataset provides a large\nnumber of paired CT and MRI images, supporting modality conversion model training; for image reconstruction tasks, we\nrewrote and adjusted the LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b) dataset.\nData Processing: After data collection, we performed filtering and processing of the raw data. For VisualQA tasks, we stan-\ndardized the data entries into two forms: open-ended questions and single-choice questions, enabling flexible training and\nevaluation. Additionally, considering that multi-image data has a minimal impact on performance but introduces extra padding\nand training time, we excluded multi-image data. For the scanned image data in generation tasks, we applied slicing extrac-\ntion, image registration, data augmentation, and normalization to treat 2D images as visual inputs for model training or used\nVQGAN-generated indices to supervise the generation tasks.\nData Statistics This section provides detailed statistical information about the VL-Health dataset to offer a more compre-\nhensive understanding.\nData Overview: To ensure a balanced development of the model’s comprehension and generation capabilities, in addition\nto the LLaV A-558k and PubMedVision-PT datasets used for alignment, the VL-Health dataset ultimately selected 765,802\nadditional visual question-answering (VQA) training samples (to endow the model with visual comprehension and instruction-\nfollowing capabilities) and 783,045 generation training samples (to provide the model with reconstruction and visual generation\ninstruction-following abilities). This contributes to the transfer of knowledge between comprehension and generation tasks, en-\nhancing the model’s overall performance. For medical image comprehension tasks, images were selected from VQA-RAD (ap-\nproximately 450 images), SLAKE (approximately 630 images), PathVQA (approximately 2,600 images), MIMIC-CXR-VQA\n(approximately 52,000 images), LLaV A-Med (approximately 61,000 images), and PubMedVision (approximately 500,000 im-\nages). Multiple question-answer pairs were retained for each image to enhance the model’s understanding and generalization\nof the image content. Table 8 shows the data distribution ofVL-Health for three-stage learning strategy, where mixed-47k is\nbased on the sampling of all data in stage-1.\nDiversity and Quality Assessment: VL-Health covers 11 modalities, including CT, MRI, X-ray, microscopy, OCT, ultra-\nsound, and fundus photography, which aids the model in learning features from various modalities. The dataset also encom-\npasses a wide range of diseases, from common to rare, and from localized lesions to systemic diseases, including pulmonary\ndiseases, skeletal abnormalities, brain lesions, tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and cellular abnormalities. This provides com-\nprehensive training support to the model, enabling it to learn the characteristics and diagnosis of various diseases.\n13', '<2-hop>\n\ntential task interference.

Additionally, through minimal mixed-task training, we\nbuilt fusion embedding layers and output heads that merge\ntext and visual tokens, establishing a unified LVLM founda-\ntion for visual instruction fine-tuning. In the third stage, by\nonly training the H-LoRA plugins, HealthGPT is able to\nrapidly adapt to a wide range of downstream medical tasks,\ncovering various types of medical comprehension and gen-\neration tasks.\nTo effectively implement our approach, we have cu-\nrated a dataset for training unified medical LVLMs, called\nVL-Health, including seven comprehension tasks and five\ngeneration tasks (Figure 1). Through quantitative analysis\nand validation on multi-modal tasks, the results demonstrate\nthat HealthGPT is capable of unifying medical multi-\nmodal abilities in data-constrained scenarios, achieving per-\nformance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-\nart (SOTA) models across multiple metrics.

We present H-LoRA, an\noptimized multi-LoRA PEFT architecture based on task-\ngated decoupling, is designed to effectively mitigate data\nconflict issues.\n• Holistic Training Dataset. We curated VL-Health, a\ncomprehensive dataset designed for both comprehension\nand generation tasks.\n• Superior Downstream Improvements : Extensive ex-\nperiments are conducted and the results confirm\nHealthGPT’s effectiveness in medical vision-language\ncomprehension and generation.\n2 Related Work\nMedical Vision Large Language Models. Recently, medi-\ncal vision large language models (Med-VLLMs) have made\nsignificant progress, demonstrating excellent performance\nin understanding medical images and responding to human\nqueries based on these images (Zhou et al. 2023; Tian et al.\n2023). XrayGPT (Thawkar et al. 2023) combines a med-\nical visual encoder (MedClip) (Wang et al. 2022) with a\nfine-tuned LLM , using a simple linear transformation layer\nto achieve alignment between visual and textual informa-\ntion, significantly enhancing the understanding of medical\nimages. On this basis, LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) fur-\nther enhances visual-text alignment in medical contexts by\nselecting high-quality image-text pairs from PubMed pa-\npers and synthesized VQA datasets. BiomedGPT (Luo et al.\n2024b) employs a BERT-style encoder and GPT-style de-\ncoder architecture, pre-trained on interdisciplinary datasets.\nCompared to commercial models like Med-PaLM (Singhal\net al. 2023), BiomedGPT significantly reduces model size\nwhile maintaining superior performance. However, issues\nof language adaptability and dataset specificity still remain.\nTo address these, HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)\nintroduces the PubMedVision dataset, which contains 1.3\nmillion high-quality medical samples, significantly improv-\ning the model’s adaptability across diverse medical applica-\ntions. However, current Med-VLLMs mainly focus on med-\nical comprehension and lack the capability for the medical\nvision-language generation.\nUnified Visual Comprehension and Generation Mod-\nels. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on cre-\nating unified LVLMs that are adept at understanding and\nproducing content across various visual modalities. NExT-\nGPT (Wu et al. 2023) achieves perception and generation for\narbitrary combinations of multi-modal inputs and outputs by\naligning LLMs. Similarly, SEED (Ge et al. 2023), SEED-\nX (Ge et al. 2024), and DreamLLM (Dong et al. 2023) em-\nploy learnable queries and leverage next-token prediction to\ngenerate visual tokens, providing conditional inputs to exter-\nnal generation modules. Unlike these methods, which func-\ntion as external conditioners, Unified-IO (Lu et al. 2022),\nUnified-IO 2 (Lu et al. 2024), and Chameleon (Team 2024)\ninternalize multi-modal generation tasks within a unified\nTransformer architecture by extending multi-modal vocab-\nularies, enabling direct generation based on next-token pre-\ndiction. Building on this concept, Lumina-mGPT (Liu et al.\n2024a) and ANOLE (Chern et al. 2024) further enhance the\ngeneration capabilities of unified models using high-quality\ndata, particularly improving the quality and flexibility of im-\nage generation.\n3 Preliminaries\nLarge Vision-Language Models.The input to a LVLM typ-\nically consists of an image ximg and a discrete text sequence\nxtxt.

Unlike methods that train both tasks\nsimultaneously, our approach reduces performance degra-\ndation from task conflicts (see Table 5). In the medical vi-\nsual comprehension task, mixed training causes catastrophic\nforgetting and degrades visual reconstruction, whereas our\nstrategy effectively uses the medical embedding knowledge\nin pre-trained LLMs to mitigate these conflicts. Meanwhile,\nwe examine how fusing heterogeneous H-LoRA plugins in\nthe second training stage results in minimal performance\ndegradation. Detailed results are in the Appendix.\nHierarchical Visual Perception Analysis. We conduct an\nablation analysis on visual perceptual inputs for comprehen-\nsion and generation tasks. Figure 6 shows that comprehen-\nsion tasks converge more efficiently with abstract-grained\ninputs, while generation tasks perform better with concrete-\ngrained inputs. This highlights the importance of the hier-\narchical visual perception we propose, suggesting that tai-\nloring visual inputs for specific tasks at different hierarchies\ncan significantly improve efficiency.\nReport-to-CXR Task.

(iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks.

In contrast,HealthGPT-M3, with only 3.8B pa-\nrameters, scored 61.3 on the medical multi-modal unified\ntask, significantly outperforming existing unified models in\nmedical downstream scenarios. (iii) Stable Improvement\nwith Large Base Model: Our method demonstrates excel-\nlent scalability, with HealthGPT-L14 achieving a score\nof 66.4 in the larger model configuration. This result signif-\nicantly outperforms all other models, highlighting the effec-\ntiveness of scaling up the base model for enhanced perfor-\nmance in medical tasks.\nGeneration. We study three key tasks in medical imag-\ning. (i) Modality Conversion: In this task, we focus on\nthe conversion between CT and MRI modalities for the\nbrain and pelvic regions, designing four specific sub-tasks.\nAll comparative models (Pix2Pix (Isola et al. 2017), Cy-\ncleGAN (Zhu et al. 2017), BBDM (Li et al. 2023a),\n(%)\n(%)\n（a） （b）\nFigure 6: The loss visualization (a) and performance com-\nparison (b) with respect to different visual perceptions.\nVmamba (Liu et al. 2024e), and DiffMa (Wang et al.\n2024b)) trained a separate model for each sub-task, while\nHealthGPT unify all tasks into a single training process.\nThe experimental results, shown in Table 11, demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms other methods across multi-\nple evaluation metrics. For instance, in the CT2MRI-Brain\ntask, HealthGPT-M3 achieves an SSIM of 79.38, signif-\nicantly surpassing traditional methods like Pix2Pix (71.09)\nand the recent DiffMa (71.47). (ii) Super-Resolution: We\nconduct 4× super-resolution experiments on the IXI dataset,\nwith the results presented in Table 3. Notably, most exist-\ning methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge of key\nstructures in medical images, resulting in significant short-\ncomings in detail recovery. In contrast, our method signif-\nicantly mitigates this issue. Specifically, HealthGPT-M3\nexcels in key metrics such as SSIM, PSNR, and ISE, achiev-\ning scores of 78.19, 32.76, and 34.47, respectively. Ad-\nditionally, HealthGPT-M3 achieves the lowest score of\n12.34, further validating its exceptional performance in hu-\nman visual perception. (iii) Reconstruction: We compare\nHealthGPT-M3 with unified models with reconstruction\ncapabilities, such as Unified-IO 2 and SEED-X. The results\nshow that our approach performs better controllability for vi-\nsual reconstruction. We also trainHealthGPT-L14 with a\nsimilar number of trainable parameters to the M3 version.\nHence, the similar performance between the two models\nmeets our expectations.

We conduct extensive validation of this struc-\nture, with results presented in Table 4, comparing the per-\nformance of LoRA, MoELoRA, and H-LoRA in medical\nunified comprehension and generation tasks. In the majority\nof comprehension tasks and all generation tasks, H-LoRA\ndemonstrates superior performance, particularly in the Om-\nniMedVQA benchmark, where it improved from 64.90 to\n68.50.

"How does H-LoRA enhance computational efficiency in large-scale tasks compared to MoELoRA, and what role does it play in the performance of models like HealthGPT on the OmniMedVQA benchmark?","['<1-hop>\n\nexpansion operations on the Router’s output weights to generate the appropriate shapes that match the dimensions of the in-\nput and LoRA experts while iterating through the experts. (iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks. We will\nfurther demonstrate the significant advantage of H-LoRA in training time in subsequent experiments, validating its efficiency\nin practical applications.\nC Supplemental Experimental Results\nIn this section, we include additional experiments to demonstrate the superiority of HealthGPT and articulate our design\nphilosophy.\nC.1 Results: OmniMedVQA Benchmark\nOmniMedVQA (Hu et al. 2024) is a novel, large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to\nencompass various modalities and anatomical regions by collecting diverse images from multiple medical datasets.

To address this, we propose a three-phase learning strategy to support H-LoRA, effectively mitigating inter-task\nconflicts. Specifically, the second phase (Heterogeneous H-LoRA Plugin Adaptation) integrates LLMs with different H-LoRA\nplugins into a new unified foundation by mixing the training of the embedding layers and output heads for two tasks. Figure\n9 illustrates the impact of this phase on the performance of medical comprehension and generation tasks. We observe that the\nsecond phase effectively unifies the model with minimal impact on overall performance, significantly alleviating the conflict\nissues arising from mixed training in medical scenarios.\nC.4 Human Evaluation.\n65.7 65.4 67.7 67.0\nFigure 9: Performance changes before and after the\nstage-2.\nWe further conduct human evaluation on the VQA-RAD, SLAKE,\nand PathVQA benchmarks, which contain 1,000 open-ended ques-\ntions. Specifically, we recruit 5 clinicians to rank the randomly shuf-\nfled responses from HealthGPT-L14, LLaV A-Med, HuatuoGPT-\nVision, Llama-3.2, InternVL-2 and Show-o. During the evaluation,\nquestions were randomly selected, and the model-generated responses\nwere anonymized and ranked. The results, as shown in Figure 10, in-\ndicate that HealthGPT was frequently selected as the best answer.\nThis suggests that HealthGPT has further application potential in\nmedical care scenarios.\nC.5 Reconstruction Performance\nCurrently, unified models that align visual features based on recon-\nstruction tasks include pre-LVLMs, post-LVLMs, as well as Unified-\nIO 2 (Lu et al. 2024) and SEED-X (Ge et al. 2024). To investigate the\ncontrollability of visual generation in rigorous settings such as med-\nical contexts, we evaluated the performance of these models in med-\nical image reconstruction in Table 11. Experimental results demon-\nstrate that HealthGPT exhibits the most stable reconstruction per-\nformance with a small amount of data.\n16']","H-LoRA enhances computational efficiency in large-scale tasks by maintaining a fixed additional time complexity of O(6), independent of the number of experts, unlike MoELoRA, which introduces a linear increase in time complexity with respect to the number of experts, resulting in O(5k + 1). This makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient, especially as the number of experts increases. In the context of the OmniMedVQA benchmark, HealthGPT models, which utilize H-LoRA, demonstrate superior performance. HealthGPT-M3 outperforms other models in 4 out of 7 sub-tasks, achieving an average score that exceeds cutting-edge medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). HealthGPT-L14 excels across all sub-tasks, achieving optimal or near-optimal results with an average score of 74.4, significantly surpassing other models. This indicates that H-LoRA's efficiency contributes to the high performance of HealthGPT models on complex medical visual question answering tasks.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

It is estimated that at n = 32, the training time for MoELoRA could reach eight times that of LoRA, preventing it from\ncompleting training and inference. This result aligns with the analysis in Appendix B, indicating that H-LoRA not only avoids\nintroducing additional training delays compared to LoRA but also outperforms MoELoRA.\nTable 10: We explored the performance of MoELoRA and H-LoRA with different numbers of LoRA experts.

To address this, we propose a three-phase learning strategy to support H-LoRA, effectively mitigating inter-task\nconflicts. Specifically, the second phase (Heterogeneous H-LoRA Plugin Adaptation) integrates LLMs with different H-LoRA\nplugins into a new unified foundation by mixing the training of the embedding layers and output heads for two tasks. Figure\n9 illustrates the impact of this phase on the performance of medical comprehension and generation tasks. We observe that the\nsecond phase effectively unifies the model with minimal impact on overall performance, significantly alleviating the conflict\nissues arising from mixed training in medical scenarios.\nC.4 Human Evaluation.\n65.7 65.4 67.7 67.0\nFigure 9: Performance changes before and after the\nstage-2.\nWe further conduct human evaluation on the VQA-RAD, SLAKE,\nand PathVQA benchmarks, which contain 1,000 open-ended ques-\ntions. Specifically, we recruit 5 clinicians to rank the randomly shuf-\nfled responses from HealthGPT-L14, LLaV A-Med, HuatuoGPT-\nVision, Llama-3.2, InternVL-2 and Show-o. During the evaluation,\nquestions were randomly selected, and the model-generated responses\nwere anonymized and ranked. The results, as shown in Figure 10, in-\ndicate that HealthGPT was frequently selected as the best answer.\nThis suggests that HealthGPT has further application potential in\nmedical care scenarios.\nC.5 Reconstruction Performance\nCurrently, unified models that align visual features based on recon-\nstruction tasks include pre-LVLMs, post-LVLMs, as well as Unified-\nIO 2 (Lu et al. 2024) and SEED-X (Ge et al. 2024). To investigate the\ncontrollability of visual generation in rigorous settings such as med-\nical contexts, we evaluated the performance of these models in med-\nical image reconstruction in Table 11. Experimental results demon-\nstrate that HealthGPT exhibits the most stable reconstruction per-\nformance with a small amount of data.\n16']","HealthGPT-L14 excels in medical tasks, achieving optimal or near-optimal results with an average score of 74.4, significantly surpassing other models. It demonstrates superior performance in medical visual comprehension tasks, outperforming both medical-specific models and general-purpose models. The use of H-LoRA in HealthGPT-L14 contributes to its enhanced performance by providing an optimized multi-LoRA architecture for multi-task learning. H-LoRA avoids additional training delays and outperforms MoELoRA, particularly in medical unified comprehension and generation tasks, as evidenced by its superior performance in the OmniMedVQA benchmark.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

This approach emphasizes that trust is never assumed and always verified, even for AI systems. An AI agent, which acts as a new identity similar to a colleague, must obtain consent or authorization from the user before performing critical actions. For instance, in scenarios like hotel bookings, the agent should not proceed with reservations using the user's credit card without first consulting the user. This prevents the agent from making autonomous decisions that could lead to undesirable outcomes, such as booking multiple hotels without user approval. Therefore, maintaining agent identity and requiring authorization are essential to align AI agent actions with user intentions and permissions.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

How does the inclusion of LLaV A-Med in the VL-Health dataset contribute to the model's performance in medical visual question answering tasks?,"['<1-hop>\n\n（a） （b）\nFigure 8: VL-Health dataset collection distribution.\nA.3 VL-Health\nThe construction of theVL-Health dataset involves two key steps:(i) data collection, (ii) data processing, as detailed below:\nData Collection: During the collection phase, we carefully considered the diversity of medical images and the complexity of\nthe tasks, selecting appropriate subsets for comprehension and generation tasks. For comprehension tasks, we selected datasets\nsuch as VQA-RAD (Lau et al. 2018), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), PathVQA (He et al. 2020), and MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), which cover various medical imaging modalities like radiology and pathology, and include professional annotations\nto assist the model in learning tasks such as lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Additionally, large-scale multi-modal\ndatasets like LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) and PubMedVision (Chen et al. 2024a) were included to provide broader medical\nknowledge support and facilitate the training of complex reasoning tasks. For generation tasks, we focused on four mainstream\ntask categories: super-resolution image generation, modality conversion, text-to-image generation, and image reconstruction.\nThe IXI (Davies et al. 2014) dataset, containing a large number of healthy brain MRI images, is suitable for training super-\nresolution models; the MIMIC-CHEST-XRAY (Bae et al. 2024) dataset, with X-ray images and their corresponding textual\nreports, is appropriate for text-to-image generation tasks; the SynthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) dataset provides a large\nnumber of paired CT and MRI images, supporting modality conversion model training; for image reconstruction tasks, we\nrewrote and adjusted the LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b) dataset.\nData Processing: After data collection, we performed filtering and processing of the raw data. For VisualQA tasks, we stan-\ndardized the data entries into two forms: open-ended questions and single-choice questions, enabling flexible training and\nevaluation. Additionally, considering that multi-image data has a minimal impact on performance but introduces extra padding\nand training time, we excluded multi-image data. For the scanned image data in generation tasks, we applied slicing extrac-\ntion, image registration, data augmentation, and normalization to treat 2D images as visual inputs for model training or used\nVQGAN-generated indices to supervise the generation tasks.\nData Statistics This section provides detailed statistical information about the VL-Health dataset to offer a more compre-\nhensive understanding.\nData Overview: To ensure a balanced development of the model’s comprehension and generation capabilities, in addition\nto the LLaV A-558k and PubMedVision-PT datasets used for alignment, the VL-Health dataset ultimately selected 765,802\nadditional visual question-answering (VQA) training samples (to endow the model with visual comprehension and instruction-\nfollowing capabilities) and 783,045 generation training samples (to provide the model with reconstruction and visual generation\ninstruction-following abilities). This contributes to the transfer of knowledge between comprehension and generation tasks, en-\nhancing the model’s overall performance. For medical image comprehension tasks, images were selected from VQA-RAD (ap-\nproximately 450 images), SLAKE (approximately 630 images), PathVQA (approximately 2,600 images), MIMIC-CXR-VQA\n(approximately 52,000 images), LLaV A-Med (approximately 61,000 images), and PubMedVision (approximately 500,000 im-\nages). Multiple question-answer pairs were retained for each image to enhance the model’s understanding and generalization\nof the image content. Table 8 shows the data distribution ofVL-Health for three-stage learning strategy, where mixed-47k is\nbased on the sampling of all data in stage-1.\nDiversity and Quality Assessment: VL-Health covers 11 modalities, including CT, MRI, X-ray, microscopy, OCT, ultra-\nsound, and fundus photography, which aids the model in learning features from various modalities. The dataset also encom-\npasses a wide range of diseases, from common to rare, and from localized lesions to systemic diseases, including pulmonary\ndiseases, skeletal abnormalities, brain lesions, tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and cellular abnormalities.

(iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks. We will\nfurther demonstrate the significant advantage of H-LoRA in training time in subsequent experiments, validating its efficiency\nin practical applications.\nC Supplemental Experimental Results\nIn this section, we include additional experiments to demonstrate the superiority of HealthGPT and articulate our design\nphilosophy.\nC.1 Results: OmniMedVQA Benchmark\nOmniMedVQA (Hu et al. 2024) is a novel, large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to\nencompass various modalities and anatomical regions by collecting diverse images from multiple medical datasets.

"How does the LLaV A-Med model enhance visual-text alignment in medical contexts, and how does it compare to HealthGPT in terms of performance on the OmniMedVQA benchmark?","['<1-hop>\n\ntential task interference. TLS: In the first and second stages,\ngiven the heterogeneity between comprehension and gener-\nation tasks, we first train H-LoRA plugins for HealthGPT\nto incorporate both medical comprehension and generation\nknowledge, thus endowing the LLMs with capabilities for\nvision-language alignment and vision-to-vision reconstruc-\ntion. Additionally, through minimal mixed-task training, we\nbuilt fusion embedding layers and output heads that merge\ntext and visual tokens, establishing a unified LVLM founda-\ntion for visual instruction fine-tuning. In the third stage, by\nonly training the H-LoRA plugins, HealthGPT is able to\nrapidly adapt to a wide range of downstream medical tasks,\ncovering various types of medical comprehension and gen-\neration tasks.\nTo effectively implement our approach, we have cu-\nrated a dataset for training unified medical LVLMs, called\nVL-Health, including seven comprehension tasks and five\ngeneration tasks (Figure 1). Through quantitative analysis\nand validation on multi-modal tasks, the results demonstrate\nthat HealthGPT is capable of unifying medical multi-\nmodal abilities in data-constrained scenarios, achieving per-\nformance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-\nart (SOTA) models across multiple metrics. Overall, the\nmain contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n• Unified Med-LVLM. We introduce HealthGPT,\nwhich, to the best of our knowledge, is the first unified\nframework for multi-modal comprehension and genera-\ntion in complex medical scenarios.\n• Effective Learning Paradigm. We present H-LoRA, an\noptimized multi-LoRA PEFT architecture based on task-\ngated decoupling, is designed to effectively mitigate data\nconflict issues.\n• Holistic Training Dataset. We curated VL-Health, a\ncomprehensive dataset designed for both comprehension\nand generation tasks.\n• Superior Downstream Improvements : Extensive ex-\nperiments are conducted and the results confirm\nHealthGPT’s effectiveness in medical vision-language\ncomprehension and generation.\n2 Related Work\nMedical Vision Large Language Models. Recently, medi-\ncal vision large language models (Med-VLLMs) have made\nsignificant progress, demonstrating excellent performance\nin understanding medical images and responding to human\nqueries based on these images (Zhou et al. 2023; Tian et al.\n2023). XrayGPT (Thawkar et al. 2023) combines a med-\nical visual encoder (MedClip) (Wang et al. 2022) with a\nfine-tuned LLM , using a simple linear transformation layer\nto achieve alignment between visual and textual informa-\ntion, significantly enhancing the understanding of medical\nimages. On this basis, LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) fur-\nther enhances visual-text alignment in medical contexts by\nselecting high-quality image-text pairs from PubMed pa-\npers and synthesized VQA datasets. BiomedGPT (Luo et al.\n2024b) employs a BERT-style encoder and GPT-style de-\ncoder architecture, pre-trained on interdisciplinary datasets.\nCompared to commercial models like Med-PaLM (Singhal\net al. 2023), BiomedGPT significantly reduces model size\nwhile maintaining superior performance. However, issues\nof language adaptability and dataset specificity still remain.\nTo address these, HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)\nintroduces the PubMedVision dataset, which contains 1.3\nmillion high-quality medical samples, significantly improv-\ning the model’s adaptability across diverse medical applica-\ntions. However, current Med-VLLMs mainly focus on med-\nical comprehension and lack the capability for the medical\nvision-language generation.\nUnified Visual Comprehension and Generation Mod-\nels. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on cre-\nating unified LVLMs that are adept at understanding and\nproducing content across various visual modalities. NExT-\nGPT (Wu et al. 2023) achieves perception and generation for\narbitrary combinations of multi-modal inputs and outputs by\naligning LLMs. Similarly, SEED (Ge et al. 2023), SEED-\nX (Ge et al. 2024), and DreamLLM (Dong et al. 2023) em-\nploy learnable queries and leverage next-token prediction to\ngenerate visual tokens, providing conditional inputs to exter-\nnal generation modules. Unlike these methods, which func-\ntion as external conditioners, Unified-IO (Lu et al. 2022),\nUnified-IO 2 (Lu et al. 2024), and Chameleon (Team 2024)\ninternalize multi-modal generation tasks within a unified\nTransformer architecture by extending multi-modal vocab-\nularies, enabling direct generation based on next-token pre-\ndiction. Building on this concept, Lumina-mGPT (Liu et al.\n2024a) and ANOLE (Chern et al. 2024) further enhance the\ngeneration capabilities of unified models using high-quality\ndata, particularly improving the quality and flexibility of im-\nage generation.\n3 Preliminaries\nLarge Vision-Language Models.The input to a LVLM typ-\nically consists of an image ximg and a discrete text sequence\nxtxt. The visual encoder Eimg converts the input image ximg\ninto a sequence of visual tokens V = [ vi]Nv\ni=1, while the\ntext sequence xtxt is mapped into a sequence of text to-\nkens T = [ ti]Nt\ni=1 using an embedding function Etxt. The\nLLM MLLM(·|θ) models the joint probability of the token\nsequence U = {V, T }, which is expressed as:\nPθ(R|U) =\nNrY\ni=1\nPθ(ri|{U, r<i}), (1)\nwhere R = [ri]Nr\ni=1 is the text response sequence. The LVLM\niteratively generates the next token ri based on r<i. The op-\ntimization objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss of\nthe response R. It is worth noting that most LVLMs adopt\n3', '<2-hop>\n\nexpansion operations on the Router’s output weights to generate the appropriate shapes that match the dimensions of the in-\nput and LoRA experts while iterating through the experts. (iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks. We will\nfurther demonstrate the significant advantage of H-LoRA in training time in subsequent experiments, validating its efficiency\nin practical applications.\nC Supplemental Experimental Results\nIn this section, we include additional experiments to demonstrate the superiority of HealthGPT and articulate our design\nphilosophy.\nC.1 Results: OmniMedVQA Benchmark\nOmniMedVQA (Hu et al. 2024) is a novel, large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to\nencompass various modalities and anatomical regions by collecting diverse images from multiple medical datasets.

"How does the SLAKE dataset contribute to the performance of HealthGPT-L14 in medical comprehension tasks, and what role does H-LoRA play in enhancing this performance?","['<1-hop>\n\n（a） （b）\nFigure 8: VL-Health dataset collection distribution.\nA.3 VL-Health\nThe construction of theVL-Health dataset involves two key steps:(i) data collection, (ii) data processing, as detailed below:\nData Collection: During the collection phase, we carefully considered the diversity of medical images and the complexity of\nthe tasks, selecting appropriate subsets for comprehension and generation tasks. For comprehension tasks, we selected datasets\nsuch as VQA-RAD (Lau et al. 2018), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), PathVQA (He et al. 2020), and MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), which cover various medical imaging modalities like radiology and pathology, and include professional annotations\nto assist the model in learning tasks such as lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Additionally, large-scale multi-modal\ndatasets like LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) and PubMedVision (Chen et al. 2024a) were included to provide broader medical\nknowledge support and facilitate the training of complex reasoning tasks. For generation tasks, we focused on four mainstream\ntask categories: super-resolution image generation, modality conversion, text-to-image generation, and image reconstruction.\nThe IXI (Davies et al. 2014) dataset, containing a large number of healthy brain MRI images, is suitable for training super-\nresolution models; the MIMIC-CHEST-XRAY (Bae et al. 2024) dataset, with X-ray images and their corresponding textual\nreports, is appropriate for text-to-image generation tasks; the SynthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) dataset provides a large\nnumber of paired CT and MRI images, supporting modality conversion model training; for image reconstruction tasks, we\nrewrote and adjusted the LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b) dataset.\nData Processing: After data collection, we performed filtering and processing of the raw data. For VisualQA tasks, we stan-\ndardized the data entries into two forms: open-ended questions and single-choice questions, enabling flexible training and\nevaluation. Additionally, considering that multi-image data has a minimal impact on performance but introduces extra padding\nand training time, we excluded multi-image data. For the scanned image data in generation tasks, we applied slicing extrac-\ntion, image registration, data augmentation, and normalization to treat 2D images as visual inputs for model training or used\nVQGAN-generated indices to supervise the generation tasks.\nData Statistics This section provides detailed statistical information about the VL-Health dataset to offer a more compre-\nhensive understanding.\nData Overview: To ensure a balanced development of the model’s comprehension and generation capabilities, in addition\nto the LLaV A-558k and PubMedVision-PT datasets used for alignment, the VL-Health dataset ultimately selected 765,802\nadditional visual question-answering (VQA) training samples (to endow the model with visual comprehension and instruction-\nfollowing capabilities) and 783,045 generation training samples (to provide the model with reconstruction and visual generation\ninstruction-following abilities). This contributes to the transfer of knowledge between comprehension and generation tasks, en-\nhancing the model’s overall performance. For medical image comprehension tasks, images were selected from VQA-RAD (ap-\nproximately 450 images), SLAKE (approximately 630 images), PathVQA (approximately 2,600 images), MIMIC-CXR-VQA\n(approximately 52,000 images), LLaV A-Med (approximately 61,000 images), and PubMedVision (approximately 500,000 im-\nages). Multiple question-answer pairs were retained for each image to enhance the model’s understanding and generalization\nof the image content. Table 8 shows the data distribution ofVL-Health for three-stage learning strategy, where mixed-47k is\nbased on the sampling of all data in stage-1.\nDiversity and Quality Assessment: VL-Health covers 11 modalities, including CT, MRI, X-ray, microscopy, OCT, ultra-\nsound, and fundus photography, which aids the model in learning features from various modalities. The dataset also encom-\npasses a wide range of diseases, from common to rare, and from localized lesions to systemic diseases, including pulmonary\ndiseases, skeletal abnormalities, brain lesions, tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and cellular abnormalities.

The experimental results are presented\nin Table 10. As the number of experts increases, the training time for MoELoRA is significantly prolonged. When n = 8 ,\nthe training time for MoELoRA is twice that of LoRA, whereas H-LoRA incurs no additional training delay and performs\nbetter. It is estimated that at n = 32, the training time for MoELoRA could reach eight times that of LoRA, preventing it from\ncompleting training and inference. This result aligns with the analysis in Appendix B, indicating that H-LoRA not only avoids\nintroducing additional training delays compared to LoRA but also outperforms MoELoRA.\nTable 10: We explored the performance of MoELoRA and H-LoRA with different numbers of LoRA experts.

To address this, we propose a three-phase learning strategy to support H-LoRA, effectively mitigating inter-task\nconflicts. Specifically, the second phase (Heterogeneous H-LoRA Plugin Adaptation) integrates LLMs with different H-LoRA\nplugins into a new unified foundation by mixing the training of the embedding layers and output heads for two tasks. Figure\n9 illustrates the impact of this phase on the performance of medical comprehension and generation tasks.

The results, as shown in Figure 10, in-\ndicate that HealthGPT was frequently selected as the best answer.\nThis suggests that HealthGPT has further application potential in\nmedical care scenarios.\nC.5 Reconstruction Performance\nCurrently, unified models that align visual features based on recon-\nstruction tasks include pre-LVLMs, post-LVLMs, as well as Unified-\nIO 2 (Lu et al. 2024) and SEED-X (Ge et al. 2024). To investigate the\ncontrollability of visual generation in rigorous settings such as med-\nical contexts, we evaluated the performance of these models in med-\nical image reconstruction in Table 11.

VQGAN (Esser, Rombach, and Ommer 2021)\nemploys latent space compression and indexing mechanisms\nto effectively learn a complete discrete representation of im-\nages. VQGAN first maps the input imageximg to a latent rep-\nresentation z = E(x) through a encoder E. Then, the latent\nrepresentation is quantized using a codebookZ = {zk}K\nk=1,\ngenerating a discrete index sequence I = [im]N\nm=1, where\nim ∈ Zrepresents the quantized code index:\nI = Quantize(z|Z) = arg min\nzk∈Z\n∥z − zk∥2. (2)\nIn our approach, the discrete index sequence I serves as\na supervisory signal for the generation task, enabling the\nmodel to predict the index sequence ˆI from input conditions\nsuch as text or other modality signals. Finally, the predicted\nindex sequence ˆI is upsampled by the VQGAN decoder G,\ngenerating the high-quality image ˆximg = G(ˆI).\nLow Rank Adaptation.

The scaling\nfactor α/r controls the impact of ∆W on the model.\n4 HealthGPT\n4.1 Unified Autoregressive Generation.\nHealthGPT (Figure 3) utilizes a discrete token representa-\ntion that covers both text and visual outputs, unifying visual\ncomprehension and generation as an autoregressive task. For\ncomprehension, Mllm receives the input joint sequence U\nand outputs a series of text token R = [ r1, r2, . . . , rNr ],\nwhere ri ∈ Vtxt, and Vtxt represents the LLM’s vocabulary:\nPθ(R | U) =\nNrY\ni=1\nPθ(ri | U, r<i). (4)\nFor generation, Mllm first receives a special start token\n⟨START IMG⟩, then generates a series of tokens corre-\nsponding to the VQGAN indices I = [ i1, i2, . . . , iNi ],\nwhere ij ∈ Vvq, and Vvq represents the index range of VQ-\nGAN. Upon completion of generation, the LLM outputs an\nend token ⟨END IMG⟩:\nPθ(I | U) =\nNiY\nj=1\nPθ(ij | U, i<j). (5)\nFinally, the generated index sequence I is fed into the de-\ncoder G, which reconstructs the target image ˆximg = G(I).\n4.2 Hierarchical Visual Perception\nGiven the differences in visual perception between compre-\nhension and generation tasks—where the former focuses on\nabstract semantics and the latter emphasizes complete se-\nmantics—we employ ViT to compress the image into dis-\ncrete visual tokens at multiple hierarchical levels.

VQGAN (Esser, Rombach, and Ommer 2021)\nemploys latent space compression and indexing mechanisms\nto effectively learn a complete discrete representation of im-\nages. VQGAN first maps the input imageximg to a latent rep-\nresentation z = E(x) through a encoder E. Then, the latent\nrepresentation is quantized using a codebookZ = {zk}K\nk=1,\ngenerating a discrete index sequence I = [im]N\nm=1, where\nim ∈ Zrepresents the quantized code index:\nI = Quantize(z|Z) = arg min\nzk∈Z\n∥z − zk∥2.

Finally, the predicted\nindex sequence ˆI is upsampled by the VQGAN decoder G,\ngenerating the high-quality image ˆximg = G(ˆI).\nLow Rank Adaptation. LoRA(Hu et al. 2021) effectively\ncaptures the characteristics of downstream tasks by intro-\nducing low-rank adapters. The core idea is to decompose\nthe bypass weight matrix ∆W ∈ Rdin×dout\ninto two low-\nrank matrices {A ∈ Rdin×r, B ∈ Rr×dout\n}, where r ≪\nmin{din, dout}, significantly reducing learnable parameters.\nThe output with the LoRA adapter for the input x is then\ngiven by:\nh = xW0 + αx∆W/r = xW0 + αxAB/r, (3)\nwhere matrix A is initialized with a Gaussian distribution,\nwhile the matrixB is initialized as a zero matrix. The scaling\nfactor α/r controls the impact of ∆W on the model.\n4 HealthGPT\n4.1 Unified Autoregressive Generation.\nHealthGPT (Figure 3) utilizes a discrete token representa-\ntion that covers both text and visual outputs, unifying visual\ncomprehension and generation as an autoregressive task. For\ncomprehension, Mllm receives the input joint sequence U\nand outputs a series of text token R = [ r1, r2, . . . , rNr ],\nwhere ri ∈ Vtxt, and Vtxt represents the LLM’s vocabulary:\nPθ(R | U) =\nNrY\ni=1\nPθ(ri | U, r<i).

At the task level, for each task type\nT, we dynamically assign a dedicated H-LoRA submodule\nθT , which is expressed as:\nR = MLLM(U|θ, θT ), θ T = {AT , BT , RT\nouter}. (7)\nAt the feature level for a single task, H-LoRA integrates the\nidea of Mixture of Experts (MoE) (Masoudnia and Ebrahim-\npour 2014) and designs an efficient matrix merging and rout-\ning weight allocation mechanism, thus avoiding the signif-\nicant computational delay introduced by matrix splitting in\nexisting MoELoRA (Luo et al. 2024a).

In the prompt management section, the AI gateway allows for the use of system decorators and templating to define prompts, which can be appended with user-specific information such as guest name and preferences. This ensures that the language model (LLM) is aware of its role, such as acting as a hotel booking assistant, without needing to communicate the entire prompt each time. In the adaptive routing section, the AI gateway enables better decision-making about model invocation through policies like model round robin, weighted round robin, and model failover. These policies allow for efficient routing of requests to different models or endpoints, ensuring optimal performance and adaptability. For instance, the model failover policy can route requests to a primary model until it is exhausted, then fallback to a secondary model.

We curate VL-Health dataset (see Fig-\nure 4). For medical visual comprehension, we leverage\nmultiple medical-specific datasets, including PubMedVi-\nsion (Chen et al. 2024a), LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b),\nPathVQA (He et al. 2020), MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), and VQA-RAD (Lau\net al. 2018). Additionally, we incorporate high-quality open-\nworld data from LLaV A-1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b) to preserve\nthe model’s general knowledge and instruction-following\ncapabilities. For generation tasks, we construct a recon-\nstruction dataset based on LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b),\nand also explore two key tasks in personalized medical\nimage enhancement—super-resolution and modality con-\nversion—using the IXI (Davies et al. 2014) and Syn-\nthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) datasets. Detailed data\nselection and instruction templates are in the Appendix.\nModel Details. We select CLIP-L/14 (Radford et al. 2021)\nas the visual encoder and used the hidden states of its\nsecond and penultimate layers as concrete-grained and\nabstract-grained features for model’s dynamic hierarchical\nvisual perception. Drawing on the successful experiences of\nLLaV A, we employ a MLP to align the multi-modal fea-\nture embeddings. We choose the parameter-efficient phi-3-\nmini (Abdin et al. 2024) and phi-4 (Abdin et al. 2024) as the\nbase model. For visual comprehension and generation tasks,\nwe set the rank of H-LoRA to 16 and 64, with four experts.\nAdditionally, we use the f8-8192 version of VQGAN as the\nimage indexing and upsampling module.\n5.2 Main Experiments\nComprehension. We compare HealthGPT with several\nexisting models, including medical-specific LVLMs (e.g.,\nMed-Flamingo (Moor et al. 2023), LLaV A-Med (Li et al.\n2024b), HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)) as well\nas recent open-world LVLMs (e.g., BLIP-2 (Li et al.\n2023b), LLaV A-v1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b), InstructBLIP (Dai\net al. 2023), Yi-VL (Young et al. 2024), InternVL2 (Chen\n6', '<2-hop>\n\n（a） （b）\nFigure 8: VL-Health dataset collection distribution.\nA.3 VL-Health\nThe construction of theVL-Health dataset involves two key steps:(i) data collection, (ii) data processing, as detailed below:\nData Collection: During the collection phase, we carefully considered the diversity of medical images and the complexity of\nthe tasks, selecting appropriate subsets for comprehension and generation tasks. For comprehension tasks, we selected datasets\nsuch as VQA-RAD (Lau et al. 2018), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), PathVQA (He et al. 2020), and MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), which cover various medical imaging modalities like radiology and pathology, and include professional annotations\nto assist the model in learning tasks such as lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Additionally, large-scale multi-modal\ndatasets like LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) and PubMedVision (Chen et al. 2024a) were included to provide broader medical\nknowledge support and facilitate the training of complex reasoning tasks. For generation tasks, we focused on four mainstream\ntask categories: super-resolution image generation, modality conversion, text-to-image generation, and image reconstruction.\nThe IXI (Davies et al. 2014) dataset, containing a large number of healthy brain MRI images, is suitable for training super-\nresolution models; the MIMIC-CHEST-XRAY (Bae et al. 2024) dataset, with X-ray images and their corresponding textual\nreports, is appropriate for text-to-image generation tasks; the SynthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) dataset provides a large\nnumber of paired CT and MRI images, supporting modality conversion model training; for image reconstruction tasks, we\nrewrote and adjusted the LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b) dataset.\nData Processing: After data collection, we performed filtering and processing of the raw data. For VisualQA tasks, we stan-\ndardized the data entries into two forms: open-ended questions and single-choice questions, enabling flexible training and\nevaluation. Additionally, considering that multi-image data has a minimal impact on performance but introduces extra padding\nand training time, we excluded multi-image data. For the scanned image data in generation tasks, we applied slicing extrac-\ntion, image registration, data augmentation, and normalization to treat 2D images as visual inputs for model training or used\nVQGAN-generated indices to supervise the generation tasks.\nData Statistics This section provides detailed statistical information about the VL-Health dataset to offer a more compre-\nhensive understanding.\nData Overview: To ensure a balanced development of the model’s comprehension and generation capabilities, in addition\nto the LLaV A-558k and PubMedVision-PT datasets used for alignment, the VL-Health dataset ultimately selected 765,802\nadditional visual question-answering (VQA) training samples (to endow the model with visual comprehension and instruction-\nfollowing capabilities) and 783,045 generation training samples (to provide the model with reconstruction and visual generation\ninstruction-following abilities). This contributes to the transfer of knowledge between comprehension and generation tasks, en-\nhancing the model’s overall performance. For medical image comprehension tasks, images were selected from VQA-RAD (ap-\nproximately 450 images), SLAKE (approximately 630 images), PathVQA (approximately 2,600 images), MIMIC-CXR-VQA\n(approximately 52,000 images), LLaV A-Med (approximately 61,000 images), and PubMedVision (approximately 500,000 im-\nages). Multiple question-answer pairs were retained for each image to enhance the model’s understanding and generalization\nof the image content. Table 8 shows the data distribution ofVL-Health for three-stage learning strategy, where mixed-47k is\nbased on the sampling of all data in stage-1.\nDiversity and Quality Assessment: VL-Health covers 11 modalities, including CT, MRI, X-ray, microscopy, OCT, ultra-\nsound, and fundus photography, which aids the model in learning features from various modalities. The dataset also encom-\npasses a wide range of diseases, from common to rare, and from localized lesions to systemic diseases, including pulmonary\ndiseases, skeletal abnormalities, brain lesions, tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and cellular abnormalities. This provides com-\nprehensive training support to the model, enabling it to learn the characteristics and diagnosis of various diseases.\n13']","The LLaV A-Med model, with 7 billion parameters, shows competitive performance in medical visual comprehension tasks. It achieves scores of 60.2 on VQA-RAD, 48.1 on SLAKE, and 58.4 on PathVQA, indicating its strong capability in these areas. The VL-Health dataset plays a crucial role in training models like LLaV A-Med by providing a diverse collection of medical images and tasks. It includes datasets such as VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, which cover various medical imaging modalities and include professional annotations. This comprehensive dataset supports the model in learning tasks such as lesion detection and disease diagnosis, enhancing its overall performance in medical visual comprehension.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How does the integration of GPT4 enhance the functionality of a staff allocation agent in a business platform, and what security measures should be considered during this integration?","[""<1-hop>\n\n## [922.00s] Staff Allocation Agent\nAnd then  \nthere's a different agent which is a  \nstaff allocation agent who is uh working  \nbehind in the background. So it will get  \ntriggered based on uh when when someone  \nis made make a booking and then it will  \ngo through the user's personal profile  \nand allocate someone from the staff for  \nthat particular booking instance. Let's  \nlook at where we want to add different  \ndifferent uh security boundaries in this  \nagentic uh when you are introducing  \nagentic AI into this platform. So  \none thing is this user and the agent and  \nthat component where the u user  \ninteracts with the uh system and then  \nfrom there there are different lines  \ngoing into the backend system and  \nthere's another boundary where these uh  \nbackend systems are there and these uh  \nthis backend system may call different  \nother parties as well. So there are  \nrequests coming into this system and  \nthis there are requests going out of  \nthis uh system as well. So the all of  \nthese lines we we need to be securing  \nand then the the ambient agent I was  \ntalking about. So it's also getting  \nrequest uh to it to the agent to do  \ndifferent task and then for to do its  \ntask it want to talk to the uh this uh  \nbusiness's backend APIs and then also it  \nneed to make updates to the exist the  \nbooking that was made earlier. So that  \nso there's another u parameter for  \nthat as well. And then so the finally  \nthe uh AI model so you can it could be a  \nGPT4 or  \nfrom different uh kind of provider but  \nregardless of what's the uh AI model  \nthat you're using there there's  \nconnections that happening from your uh  \nbusinesses uh to this external AI model.  \nSo that there's another parameter there  \nwe that we need to be securing and also  \nthis is the parameter where we should be  \napplying this guard drills and  \ngovernance layer that Arshad was earlier  \ntalking about.""]","The integration of GPT4 into a staff allocation agent enhances the functionality of a business platform by enabling advanced AI-driven decision-making processes. The agent works in the background, triggered by booking events, and utilizes user profiles to allocate staff efficiently. GPT4, or a similar AI model, can improve the accuracy and adaptability of these allocations by processing complex data inputs and providing intelligent recommendations. However, integrating such an AI model requires careful consideration of security measures. It is crucial to secure the connections between the business platform and the external AI model, ensuring that data exchanges are protected. Additionally, implementing guardrails and a governance layer is necessary to manage the interactions between the AI model and the business's backend systems, safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with data protection standards.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
