I hope you all are excited to learn a little bit about AI and specifically I mean we are going to talk a lot about generative AI. So and also we what we are going to cover here is like how the integration the role I mean the role of integration in building AI applications nowadays because we have this generative AI. So this is something very important to talk about and also we will uh discuss like what are the common integration patterns that we have when we are talking about generative AI and also another thing I mean we will extend our talk to the uh discuss the need of retrie augmented generation I will discuss all these things in detail right now I'm just going through what we are going to do and also about the agents I think it's a very hot topic nowadays you guys have heard about it and also We will talk like how we why we need model context protocol MCP and also I mean we are eager to build very good AI applications right but when we are building these AI applications we have to be responsible as well so the AI has to be responsible they have to have certain guard rates they have to have certain governance so we'll talk about those concept as well and also we'll talk about a zero trust design for AI agents because I mean you may have heard about the zor trust architectures zor trust designs but that's not for AI right that's for other stuff but we will now bring that concept into AI as well specific to the AI agents I think I have to move out of the screen because everything is shown there here yeah here so before moving forward I would like to like to define these terminologies because in case if you're not.\n\n## [115.60s] Defining AI and Generative AI\nSo what is AI? I mean AI is anything that can simulate human intelligence. It can be a small function as it can be a machine learning model. It can be a very big deep learning model and it's anything that actually simulate human intelligence. And what is actually the generative AI? So generative is again a subset of artificial intelligent where we are actually focusing on creating original content that can be text that can be audio that can be visual stuff I mean it's basically focusing on creating or generating more content and what is uh large language models or LLMs so this is I mean uh example of like chat GPT open AI all the stuff right those are large language models what is that and that is actually a again a subset of generative AI but focus on natural language so understanding text generating text and that's what it's specialization.\n\n## [185.36s] The Current State of AI\nOkay now another thing I want to discuss a little bit is why now I mean why we are talking about AI now I mean AI was there for a long time people are trying to build a lot of stuff with AI but now it things have changed right something has changed so I think the key thing is unlike before unlike the pre-eni era now AI is for everybody it's not just for the AI developer or the that machine learning expert who could build machine learning models is for everybody for example in the previous era when you build machine learning models when you build deep learning models we are working with lot of numerical or categorical features and we have to feed those features into the model. We have to process them, we have to clean them and there are a lot of things involved with that. But now it's just chatting with the model, right? So just say to the model what you need and the model will do it for you. So it's just a conversational experience for you now if you want to use AI. And the other thing is now in previous era when we want to build any AI experience or any AI application we have to train a specific model and we have to go through all these steps like train tune deploy finetune all those stuff and also uh the training will happen I mean sorry the learning process will happen when you're training the model so that's what that was the previous but now it has changed now we have this large lage models which will work for different domains, different uh task. I mean you don't have to fine-tune it. You just have to tell it okay do the text summarization or do the sentiment analysis and it doesn't have to be in the same domain. So you can apply it for different different domains. So that and also they are available as APIs as so the accessibility is very easy now you don't have to train it you can just do a API call and basically access them and other more most important point is they can also learn but I mean of course we can train them somebody has to train them right somebody has already pre-trained them and we can also fine-tune them but another important thing is they can learn during the inference as together. Of course, it's temporarily, but you can feed more information to the prompt and teach these models more information and then get them to do your task. That's a very important capability which wasn't I mean available with previous era of models.\n\n## [337.84s] Limitations of Generative AI\nYes. So you are like saying generative is great but now let's discuss like what is actually the I mean limitations or what are the uh problems with generative AI. I think one of the main problem I mean I think is the key challenge with generative AI is the hallucination hallucination means this generative mod they can lie to your face and you will believe it if you don't know your facts. So it's it can convince you really well if you don't know the facts you you will believe it. So that how uh good they are at line and that's a big problem. I mean if you look at the examples I mean these are like examples taken from like uh early generation of generative amoras they may not work with current uh state-of-the-art generative amoras but you can I mean it is just to demonstrate like for example if we take the first scenario we asking like who was the first person to walk on the moon and it's just making up facts and saying a different person I mean we all know who was the person walk on the moon for the first time, right? And just making facts, right? And then telling, okay, this was the guy and uh and that that was the only the lunar pioneer mission. And this is a type of hallucination where AI actually I mean the model actually doesn't know the fact. So it's just making it up. And that's okay for these models because these models are not actually any fact generation models. They are content generation model. They are supposed to generate some content, right? they are not supposed to I mean we don't train them to generate the factual correct content that's how they are and the other case is now to overcome these kind of problems we can actually give some context to the model give some context to the prompt and say okay this is the information like for example in this scenario we are telling in early uh October 23rd the war broke between Israel and Hamas and then we ask the model to summarize that and the the sum in the summarization the model is saying it's October 2006 and even we gave the information to the model still it can hallucinate so that's again a problem right and another problem they have is they are not I mean that good with mathematical problems I mean I assume they are good but they are not but again I mean this these things have been fixed and improved a lot with fine-tuning for the current state-of-the-art models and this is again I mean major limitation we had back then and also this is not something we are I mean as integration developers we are not that interested in this problem because we are not going to solve mathematical problems using generative models so I'm just going to uh skip it but keep in mind that's another limitation they have.\n\n## [522.08s] Solutions to Limitations\nNow we talking about the limitations of these models. Of course we have to talk about some solutions also right how we can overcome them. So one way to overcome it that is to use proper prompt engineering that means like you instruct the model in different ways so they don't run into these pitfalls. And another way to uh solve this problem is I mean it's actually part of the prompt engineering that you integrate the generative models with your I mean systems or your data so that model has the context that it doesn't know. Of course you will end up with having a combination. You will need the prompt engineering plus integration with data when you actually want to build real world applications.",

        "summary": "The text discusses the introduction and current state of AI, focusing on generative AI, which creates original content like text, audio, and visuals. It highlights the accessibility of AI through large language models (LLMs) that can perform tasks across various domains without extensive fine-tuning. However, generative AI faces limitations such as hallucinations, where models generate incorrect information, and struggles with mathematical problems. Solutions include prompt engineering and integrating models with external data to provide context. The importance of responsible AI development, including governance and zero trust design for AI agents, is also emphasized.",

I hope you all are excited to learn a little bit about AI and specifically I mean we are going to talk a lot about generative AI. So and also we what we are going to cover here is like how the integration the role I mean the role of integration in building AI applications nowadays because we have this generative AI. So this is something very important to talk about and also we will uh discuss like what are the common integration patterns that we have when we are talking about generative AI and also another thing I mean we will extend our talk to the uh discuss the need of retrie augmented generation I will discuss all these things in detail right now I'm just going through what we are going to do and also about the agents I think it's a very hot topic nowadays you guys have heard about it and also We will talk like how we why we need model context protocol MCP and also I mean we are eager to build very good AI applications right but when we are building these AI applications we have to be responsible as well so the AI has to be responsible they have to have certain guard rates they have to have certain governance so we'll talk about those concept as well and also we'll talk about a zero trust design for AI agents because I mean you may have heard about the zor trust architectures zor trust designs but that's not for AI right that's for other stuff but we will now bring that concept into AI as well specific to the AI agents I think I have to move out of the screen because everything is shown there here yeah here so before moving forward I would like to like to define these terminologies because in case if you're not.",

And what is actually the generative AI? So generative is again a subset of artificial intelligent where we are actually focusing on creating original content that can be text that can be audio that can be visual stuff I mean it's basically focusing on creating or generating more content and what is uh large language models or LLMs so this is I mean uh example of like chat GPT open AI all the stuff right those are large language models what is that and that is actually a again a subset of generative AI but focus on natural language so understanding text generating text and that's what it's specialization.",

        "page_content": "## [185.36s] The Current State of AI\nOkay now another thing I want to discuss a little bit is why now I mean why we are talking about AI now I mean AI was there for a long time people are trying to build a lot of stuff with AI but now it things have changed right something has changed so I think the key thing is unlike before unlike the pre-eni era now AI is for everybody it's not just for the AI developer or the that machine learning expert who could build machine learning models is for everybody for example in the previous era when you build machine learning models when you build deep learning models we are working with lot of numerical or categorical features and we have to feed those features into the model. We have to process them, we have to clean them and there are a lot of things involved with that. But now it's just chatting with the model, right? So just say to the model what you need and the model will do it for you. So it's just a conversational experience for you now if you want to use AI. And the other thing is now in previous era when we want to build any AI experience or any AI application we have to train a specific model and we have to go through all these steps like train tune deploy finetune all those stuff and also uh the training will happen I mean sorry the learning process will happen when you're training the model so that's what that was the previous but now it has changed now we have this large lage models which will work for different domains, different uh task. I mean you don't have to fine-tune it. You just have to tell it okay do the text summarization or do the sentiment analysis and it doesn't have to be in the same domain. So you can apply it for different different domains. So that and also they are available as APIs as so the accessibility is very easy now you don't have to train it you can just do a API call and basically access them and other more most important point is they can also learn but I mean of course we can train them somebody has to train them right somebody has already pre-trained them and we can also fine-tune them but another important thing is they can learn during the inference as together. Of course, it's temporarily, but you can feed more information to the prompt and teach these models more information and then get them to do your task. That's a very important capability which wasn't I mean available with previous era of models.",

So you are like saying generative is great but now let's discuss like what is actually the I mean limitations or what are the uh problems with generative AI. I think one of the main problem I mean I think is the key challenge with generative AI is the hallucination hallucination means this generative mod they can lie to your face and you will believe it if you don't know your facts. So it's it can convince you really well if you don't know the facts you you will believe it. So that how uh good they are at line and that's a big problem. I mean if you look at the examples I mean these are like examples taken from like uh early generation of generative amoras they may not work with current uh state-of-the-art generative amoras but you can I mean it is just to demonstrate like for example if we take the first scenario we asking like who was the first person to walk on the moon and it's just making up facts and saying a different person I mean we all know who was the person walk on the moon for the first time, right? And just making facts, right? And then telling, okay, this was the guy and uh and that that was the only the lunar pioneer mission. And this is a type of hallucination where AI actually I mean the model actually doesn't know the fact. So it's just making it up. And that's okay for these models because these models are not actually any fact generation models. They are content generation model. They are supposed to generate some content, right? they are not supposed to I mean we don't train them to generate the factual correct content that's how they are and the other case is now to overcome these kind of problems we can actually give some context to the model give some context to the prompt and say okay this is the information like for example in this scenario we are telling in early uh October 23rd the war broke between Israel and Hamas and then we ask the model to summarize that and the the sum in the summarization the model is saying it's October 2006 and even we gave the information to the model still it can hallucinate so that's again a problem right and another problem they have is they are not I mean that good with mathematical problems I mean I assume they are good but they are not but again I mean this these things have been fixed and improved a lot with fine-tuning for the current state-of-the-art models and this is again I mean major limitation we had back then and also this is not something we are I mean as integration developers we are not that interested in this problem because we are not going to solve mathematical problems using generative models so I'm just going to uh skip it but keep in mind that's another limitation they have.",

And another way to uh solve this problem is I mean it's actually part of the prompt engineering that you integrate the generative models with your I mean systems or your data so that model has the context that it doesn't know.

So I I  \nthink it's very interesting to look at  \nit for I mean if you look at the future  \nprompting this is one of the basic  \nprompt engineering techniques. So in the  \nuh left hand side we have the zero short  \nprompting approach where we just  \ninstruct the model and say I mean  \nclassify the text into neutral negative  \npositive and then we give the text I  \nthink the vacation is okay and then we  \nask the model to give the sentiment and  \nit say it's neutral I mean that  \nbasically directly telling the model  \nwhat to do but in the future prompting  \nwe have given some examples saying okay  \nthis is awesome and it's a negative  \nthing And this uh bad and it's a  \npositive thing.  \nAnd what's the movie was? Uh  \nyeah, I can't see that in close but you  \ncan see like what we have some stuff  \nright and we have given set of examples  \nto the uh  \nmodel or the LLM and then we have  \nexpected the model when we give the new  \nsample like what's the horrible sh and  \nit will basically give us the correct  \nanswer that that was we have expected.  \nSo we expected model by looking at the  \nexamples  \nyou will give the correct response and  \nwe haven't instruct it at all. I mean we  \nhaven't tell it you are doing a  \nsentiment analysis we haven't told  \nanything and this is a very important  \npattern because let's say now you have  \nthousands of instructions that you have  \nor hundred of introduction instruction  \nthat you need to give to the model to  \nfollow whatever task you want to do.  \nYou can avoid all those things just by  \ngiving set of examples. That's why this  \nis very important and powerful prompt  \nengineering technique",

I mean just having it  \nthere and just prompt it and you have  \nthis chat GBD like assistance. you can  \njust have a conversation with the uh  \nyour integration and basically get some  \nuh output and it will use the model's  \nknowledge. So it's not going to look  \ninto any external stuff. I mean very  \nsimple case is like code generation like  \nyou can do code generation without any  \nexternal stuff. So the model is capable  \nof that. I mean if you want to generate  \nin Python code you can just ask charge  \nalso right doesn't need any tools or any  \nexternal knowledge  \nand then  \nwe have the other case where actually we  \nget some other uh APIs databases real  \nworld data a context  \nand you integrate that with your  \napplication so you can you can feed that  \ninto your prompts  \nand this is really powerful because Now  \nyou can solve the knowledge cutoff  \nissues with the model because the model  \nknows only limited stuff right and also  \nmaybe it's outdated so you can solve all  \nthose problem and also for the  \nenterprises or the businesses there is a  \nreally good advantage because now you  \ncan add your private data to the model  \nwhich open doesn't know which uh  \nentropic doesn't know because they they  \ndon't know what what is happening inside  \nyour business Right?

So we have all those stuff. So now  \nwhat we can do is like we use uh this  \ngeneral integration pattern to basically  \nconnect to the WSON API and also the  \nuser profiles that we have created  \nand then give you this nice s when you  \nopen it you will see it will say okay if  \nyou're interested in AI go to this AI  \nlab  \nand this is the architecture of that. So  \nif you look at it, you have the user. So  \nuser basically I mean he's look checking  \nthe sessions right from the mobile  \napplication. Then it will send a request  \nto the our session uh session  \nintegration and that will have the user  \nID only the user ID and then we can  \nbasically uh get the agenda information  \nand also use the user ID to get the  \nprofile of you and then use that in the  \nprompt to the LLA  \nand then we can get the suggestions for  \nyou.",

        "page_content": "## [1370.24s] Understanding Vector Embeddings\nSo now to understand this a little bit deep  \nlet's try to understand what is  \na vector embedding.  \nSo vector embedding is a I mean it's a  \nvery simple thing. It's just a numerical  \nrepresentation  \nin a high dimensional space  \nand for your words for your paragraphs  \nfor your sentences. I mean in this case  \nto make it very simple I have used words  \nbut in when you build rags we are not  \nactually doing the web t for the words  \nwe are doing it for uh I mean maybe  \nparagraphs or maybe certain pieces of  \ntext documents you don't have to do it  \nfor each word okay  \nso here if you look at this now I mean I  \nwas telling like it's a high dimensional  \nrepresentation  \nof a given word or a text but I I I  \nthink is better to illustrate with the  \ndiagram what it means. So if you look at  \nthis now we can see like each  \nterm or the word has been represented  \nusing a high I mean three-dimensional  \nvector space and if you look at it you  \ncan see the cat is here and very closer  \nto the class cat we have the kitten. I'm  \nnot sure it's clear it's not clear to me  \nI hope it's clear to you  \nand then we have I mean it's obvious  \nright? So cat and kitten should be  \ncloser because cat is like the baby  \nocean of the kitt. Sorry, kitten is like  \nthe baby version of the cat. And then we  \nhave the dog a little bit closer to the  \ncat but not as much as closer to the  \nkitten because dog is again some I mean  \ndomestic animal that we usually have our  \nin our homes right similar to cats and  \nthen dog has wolf near dog but wolf is  \nfar away from the cat because wolf I  \nmean the connection between the wolf and  \nthe dog is more similar but not as much  \nas the cat and wolf right so you get the  \nidea right so basically what when we do  \nthis representation what happen is  \nwhatever sim similar will be closer in  \nthis high dimensional representation  \nand when we have that what we can do is  \nnow  \nwe can use certain mechanisms like for  \nexample you can I mean if you have taken  \ncertain math uh vector uh  \ncauses you may know like this there's  \ncosine similarity there's equity  \ndistance so there are multiple  \napproaches that you can use to measure  \nthe similarity between two vector  \nvectors and that's what actually vector  \ndatabases are using. So once we have  \nthis representation we can use that  \nvector similarity to figure out what are  \nthe actual uh similar things to whatever  \nthe query that or the question that user  \ngives to the rack  \nand actually this powers the R that  \nmeans ret in the rack and what is a  \nvector database since you know already  \nwhat is a vector embedding it's very  \neasy to understand vector database is a  \ndatabase that can easily represent  \nefficiently represent these vector  \nembeddings in such a way that you can  \nsearch them  \nefficiently faster. So if you have the  \nnormal database you can't do vector  \nsearch with those normal database like  \nrelation databases or document databases  \nyou can't do vector searches but these  \ndatabases they are fine-tuned or they  \nare optimized to do vector searches so  \nthat you can basically get the uh  \nsimilar  \ntext when you are giving a query to the  \nvector database and for I mean popular  \nexamples are pine cone v8 pg vector so  \nthere are bunch of popular uh vector  \ndatabases because this have been uh a  \npopular concept now like my I mean MySQL  \nand other databases.",

So just fetch the  \ndata and then once you have the data you  \nhave to pass and clean that because you  \ncan have your data in different  \nforms right they are unstructured they  \nare in different files. So you have to  \nbasically pass and clean and get uh some  \nI mean for example when we have HTML  \ncontent what we do is we usually pass  \nthem to markdown content and that's  \nbecause markdown uh has a nice structure  \nthat you can give to I mean when we have  \nHTML HTML has a lot of HTML tags so  \nthat's not something uh good when we are  \nusing with LLM. So it will waste a lot  \nof tokens and also it will add a lot of  \nnoise to the LLM. So we just want to get  \nrid of the HTML and we can to get it to  \na structured uh format and the best  \nformat is the  \nmarkdown usually  \nand once you have the markdown stuff I  \nmean the markdown text then you can  \nstart chunking that because now you have  \na large document again the purpose of  \nrag is reduce the content that we are  \nput into the LLM. If you have bunch of  \nlarge document and we index that into  \nthe vector DP and put that into the LLM  \nthat's going to beat the purpose of the  \nuh using rack. So you have to nicely  \nchunk it in a way that each chunk will  \nhave a content about some specific  \ntopic. Usually that's the uh approach  \nand there are different chunking  \napproaches. I mean if you're going to  \ntalk about this this this like a  \ndifferent other whole session. So I'm  \nnot going to go through that but there  \nare multiple chunking approaches that  \nyou can use. They are available in  \ndifferent frameworks. You can and once  \nyou have chunk them now we are at the  \nface we can we are using a embedding  \nmodel and then we get the vector  \nembeddings for those chunks because we  \nneed a vector representation right  \nand once you get the vector embeddings  \nnow you can go and store them in the  \nvector database and vector database will  \ndo the indexing and everything and they  \nwill map the document chunks that you",

So then agent will look at the  \nI mean agent will think like that and  \nthen agent will decide okay I need to  \nexecute the uh get user profile tool  \nfirst and also it will say okay I need  \nto execute this tool for the user Sara  \nbecause we know the user  \nand then agent will execute I mean agent  \nwill execute that tool and that won't  \ninol any LLM okay it's just a  \nprogrammatical thing but that's part of  \nthe agent. So agent will execute that  \ntool and then agent will get a response  \nback saying okay Sara has these  \npreferences. So Sara like uh warm  \nweather, she like beach, hiking, those  \nkind of activities and she has a  \nmoderate budget requirement, right?  \nAnd now agent will use that data in the  \nprompt and send it back to the LLM  \nand say okay I have executed the first  \ntool and I got this information from the  \nfirst tool. Now what I should do next  \nand it'll ask the LLM and then they  \nthink and say okay I should find the  \ndestination that matches the user's  \npreferences and I have a tool for that.  \nI have the uh that get the locations  \nthat tool right so we can use that tool  \nand also it will look at the tools input  \nschema and figure out okay what kind of  \nparameters I can put to the tool so that  \nit will improve my search experience or  \nagents I mean it's not the search  \nexperience but agent search criteria  \nright so for example in this case agent  \ncan uh give like what is the climate  \nwhat are the activities I mean we have  \nmake it a little bit artificial to  \nshowcase that capability. So the tool  \nwill take most of the parameters that we  \ngot from the first call the when we  \ncheck the personalization information.  \nSo that will be done by the LLM and LLM  \nwill send this respond back saying okay",

So with this uh platform currently customers can do the hotel discovery and also they can do the availability of the hotels or the rooms real time and also do a reservation and again basically do I mean write or read reviews so they can get understanding of what they want to basically reserve. So they can do these functionalities and I think you all are familiar with this. If you have used like booking.com those kind of a platform this is what actually they do right.",

So that makes sense. So  \nmodel context protocol of course it's  \nsay how we can standardize connecting to  \ntools resources and prompts  \nand we talk about tools. Tools are like  \nthe API call, DB queries. We discuss  \nabout tools when we are talking about  \nagents, right? So those are the tools.  \nResources is a little bit of different  \ncompared to resources that we see in  \nAPIs. So this like data resources like  \nfiles, databases and whatever you  \nconsider as contextual information  \nand prompts of course these are the uh  \nprompts that we showed in the beginning  \nthat instruct the LL name. So you can  \nhave templates of prompts and reuse that  \ntemplates over and over again in  \ndifferent application. For example, we  \ndon't have to write the prompt for rag  \nevery time we do a rag. We can have a  \ntemplate and we can reuse it when we are  \nwriting any rag in our organization.  \nSo that's what I mean that's the basic  \nidea of model context protocol.",

So it can be anything  \nlike that  \nand they need a client  \nand they use that client to connect to  \nMCP server.  \nSo MCP service use a JSON RPC protocol.  \nI mean there a lot of stuff techn stuff  \nthere but MCP server has a a fixed uh  \nspec.  \nSo the advantage is you don't have to  \nwrite the client every time you want. I  \nmean you are using the MCP server you  \ncan have a single client definition and  \nit knows how it has talk with the MCP  \nserver knows everything that it can do  \nwith the MCP server so you don't have to  \nworry about that  \nand MCP server has all the  \nimplementation required to actually  \nconnect to your data or your APIs or  \nwhatever other resource that you are  \ntrying to connect to the LLM  \nand why this important Now this is",

It's not a problem with the  \nmodel but problem with the data right  \nit's not the model is racist the data is  \nracist maybe  \nand the other thing that can happen is  \nnow as developers if you're not careful  \nenough we can do certain things that  \nactually can put I mean maybe uh leak  \nsome sensitive data because we are now  \ntrying to put information into the model  \ncontext right if you just need go and  \nconnect  \nour APIs to the agent  \nAnd if somebody comes and ask question  \nif you don't have any uh proper  \nvalidations then what would can happen?  \nI mean it will give those answers by  \nreferring to our confidential data right  \nand one of the example is  \nif you connect the model or the agent  \ndirected to the database and database  \nhas information about different users.  \nSo if you have done that with the  \nsession advisor now you can login I mean  \nlogin as you but you can ask a questions  \nas Malit. Oh my myself and then get my  \nsession sessions which is not a critical  \nthing but it can be a critical  \ninformation as well right and that can  \nhappen. So you there are certain things  \nyou shouldn't do for example you  \nshouldn't connect that to the connect  \nthe agent to the directly to the  \ndatabases unless you have proper uh  \nsecurity in place",

So  \nfor that then we have another set of  \nguard rates which will check for like  \ncensorship and also like hallucinations  \nor any whether it's discussing any  \nsensitive topics like maybe we don't  \nwant to talk about the war in Israel and  \nPalestine this maybe it's a sensitive  \ntopic in this organization maybe we have  \nto do certain censorship there as well.  \nSo when you have guard rates it has to  \nbe applied to I mean we have to apply  \nthat to the input coming to the LM and  \nalso to the output going back from the  \nLLM.",

I mean when we  \nare designing systems we never trust we  \nalways verify and we have to do the same  \nthing with AI agents as well. For  \nexample agent may try to do a critical  \nthing on behalf of a certain user. We  \nshouldn't do that without consulting the  \nuser. We have to get the consent or the  \nauthorization from the user and that's  \nwhy we need concepts like the agent  \nidentity because now agent itself is a  \nnew identity right agent is like your  \ncolleague now there is a agent who will  \nanswer your support calls and do certain  \nstuff and if it can't go beyond a  \ncertain point it will hand over to you  \nbut of course that's like a intern  \ncolleague that you have who will do the  \ngrant work and he has his own identity  \nand also he needs certain authorization  \nsometimes I mean agent can do things  \nlike for example it may look at the  \npublic data it may look at some of the  \norganization data but if it want to go  \nbeyond a certain point does take the  \nauthorization from other colleagues so  \nwhoever has the higher permission higher  \nauthorization or it can be even the user  \nlike for example in our earlier scenario  \nwhen we did the hotel booking I mean we  \ndidn't do the hotel booking and that's  \nwhy because if you are to do the hotel  \nbooking agent has should agent should go  \nback to the user and get the user This  \nis authorization before doing that uh  \nreservation because agent can I mean if  \nwe give the full autonomy to the agent  \nagent will decide like 10 hotels and go  \ndo the reservation using the user's  \ncredit card right that's going to be  \nlike a disaster",

I  \nthink you already convinced on that but  \nthere are limitations for example you  \nhave the hallucination due to the  \noutdated knowledge or it won't have  \naccess to your private data and we  \ndiscussed like how we can use a genera  \nintegrations to solve that problem and  \nalso rag and agent extend those  \ncapability like rag allow to efficiently  \ndo the uh knowledge uh injection I mean  \nknowledge uh addin and then the agents  \nallow I mean extend the capability to  \nexecute actual tools and Then we talk  \nabout like how you can standardize  \nconnecting external world things like  \nAPI databases to the genera integrations  \nusing MCP. And of course the last topic  \nis like we have to use geni responsible  \nin in the responsible manner. So we need  \nlike AI gateway or we need zero trust uh  \ndesign for when we are building AI  \nagents.  \n[4481.80s] [Music]",

So the topic was like building agents applications and tools. But why we need to build a applications? So we have to first need to establish a motivation for that. Right? So why we need to build? So we are trying to do AI transformation and we will discuss like discuss what is AI transformation and also we'll take example and business example and try to use that and say how we can do the AI transformation step by step with that business use case and then Anjen will basically bring in a W integrator to save us all because when we want to implement that in real life we need the toolkit to develop that right so and then we we basically demonstrated and how we do the transformation using W indicator so this going to be the story I I don't want to reveal a lot of stuff that's why I kept it brief in brief but now let's try to understand what is the transformation I mean this is like a I mean this it's not like well adapted term but it's there already and people are discussing about is so the basic idea is now you have a lot of business operations you have lot of things that happening in your organization now can you use AI and enhance those operations so you'll have more productivity more efficiency or a better user experience and also it can be like unlocking new capabilities that wasn't possible before.",

We have a hotel API, search API, booking API, review API and all these APIs are connecting to our internal databases where we have the hotel database and we have uh booking database which will connected to the booking API and also we have bunch of portals that we expose these capabilities to the customers. For examples, we have the hotel owners who will try to register their hotels. So they will connect to the registration portal and that will go through the hotel API and basically we will have that in our DB then and actually the customers who want to plan their trip book their trip if they want to come and basically do that operation then they have the booking portal they'll use that right so this is actually a business scenario we have already I mean familiar with right so this is what we have right now and this is going to be our system and now we have to think how we can apply a transformation information on top of this existing business APIs and of course we shouldn't forget about the data because data is our strategic asset right that's the asset actually so whatever you have for example you have the booking history of our customers and we have the search behaviors we have their reviews all those things we have already in our hand right so we have to make use of that that's a assist we have and also we have other information like the hotel information trends happening seasonal pattern also some external data maybe the weather events happening all those stuff right so those are also very important information that we can make use of when we are building this kind of I mean I didn't say what's we are going to build but it's going to be useful right if we have to think of how we can make use of this information because we have AI capabilities that can do that now.",

So we have to come up with a vision where we want to reach. So where we want to reach now with this business is we need to have a intelligent interactive experience that we can give to the users. So they can go and do a trip planning. they can basically say this is my budget, this is what I want and this is going to be my uh basically uh the activities that I'm looking for. So those kind of things they can say to the system and they can get a good uh trip uh plan and then they can basically do the uh reservations or bookings following that plan. So that kind of experience and also we have this strategy data I mentioned them earlier. So we want to make use of them and then basically give a better experience to our customers. For example, if you know about their uh booking patterns or what they like, we can make good sessions to them, right? That's what actually we are doing in our WA application as well. We make use of what you what your interest are and when we are trying to use that to give session sessions so you know which sessions that you can attend in your mobile application.",

So of course there are two ways. One way is you go and basically throw away all the APIs you have and then come up with a set of uh system I mean APIs or system whatever integrations and then consider that as your new experience but that's too risky because we are still in a domain that there are a lot of unknowns there are a lot of possibilities we don't want to just throw away what we have right now we want to keep it there because even customers are in a transition period we don't know whe the customers will like the I mean if we have a chat experience. We don't know whether they will like it, right? They don't like it. They don't they want the old portal. So, we don't want to throw away that. We don't want to throw away the existing business. Going to keep it as it is. But on top of that, can we bring our new capabilities? So, that's a good question to ask if we actually doing a transformation and we will kind of showcase like what will be the uh end product look like. I think Anja can basically take us through the demo.",

It  \ncan't go beyond that. It can't get the  \nhotel availability real time if we  \nhaven't provided that information. I  \nmean we can't give the hotel  \navailability for all the hotel to the  \nprompt right that's not practical. We  \ncan't I mean that general integration  \ncannot actually do actual booking. We  \njust can answer questions but it can't  \ndo that operation and also uh the  \npersonalization across the session won't  \nhappen also because now this gen uh  \nintegration it may have access to what  \nwe have provided as the person session  \ninformation but that's it right it can't  \nremember you the agent can remember you  \nbut this gender integration it can't  \nand that's why we need AI agent for this  \nscenario IO  \nand  \nbecause we have to listen and act  \ndynamically, we also have to connect to  \nbusiness APIs like the booking uh API  \nand also we have to leverage the  \npersonalization. So we have to basically  \nget autonomous uh system right to do  \nthese things. So that's why we need AI  \nagent.

We have  \nthat capability and then we have the  \ncapability for you guys to build AI  \napplications for your enterprise use  \ncases using BI as well. Right? So that  \nis one of the uh key areas that we are  \nfocusing and uh when when it comes to  \nthe product development right so um and  \nthen yeah uh bit of recap right so as  \nNadis mentioned earlier back in the day  \nif we let's say I think um like five  \nyears ago right if you wanted to let's  \nsay I'm I'm a platform like um a booking  \ncompany right if I wanted to transform  \nmy if I wanted to add a add a single AI  \nfeature into my product. I had to hire a  \nlot of data science engineers, right? I  \nhad to have like entire separate teams.  \nSo, you have to have a lot of data. We  \nhave to start from data, right? We have  \nto have a lot of engineers who are data  \nexperts, build the models, right? For each  \nfeature, you have to build the model,  \ndeploy it, right? It's very annoying.  \nNow, now is the time. Now, uh it's more  \naccessible than ever, right? So, now  \nit's there are very capable reasoning  \nmodels, AI models up up and running in  \ncloud providers. we just have to connect  \nto it. Right? So that that brings me to  \nmy next point.

The  \nhello agent, right? Uh, so this is a you  \ncan see the screen there's no it's no  \nissues, right? Yeah. Um,  \nso yeah, this is a empty project  \ncompletely empty project. I haven't done  \nanything, right? So what we want to do  \nis we want to build a hello agent  \napplication right. So all you have to do  \nis you have to go to add artifact right  \nuh just like in any other integration  \ntool you will see like you can make  \ncreate automations HTTP services right  \nuh file integrations event integrations  \neverything but what I'm interested in  \nhere is none of those things right this  \nAI agent part right so if I click that  \nand I say I have to give it a name right  \nI'll just call it creating agent  \num  \nmaybe I'll zoom in a bit. Yeah, sorry.  \nUm,  \nso it's creating the agent.  \nUm, yeah. So, once it's done, you will  \nsee this pretty diagram, right, for the  \nagent that we are building. So, as of  \nnow, this is like very blank. I agree,  \nright? But, um, if you click on this,  \nyou will you can see you can assign a  \nrole to this, right? You can give  \nspecific instruction on what to do,  \nright? And um various things. And if you  \nclick on this icon, you will see you can  \nselect the model provider here. What we  \nhave is the default model provider from  \nWS2. But we can have open athropic  \nanything, right? So the default just to  \nbe clear the default model provider is  \nsomething that we provide. This is this  \nis a service that we provide to get you  \nstarted with uh aava features right so  \nthis is essentially an open air proxy  \nfor now but uh so yeah this is very  \nhelpful when you want to get started  \nwith with the project and maybe debug  \nright so I'm just going to use defaults  \nI don't want to do anything right so um  \nyeah so I need to execute this  \nparticular command to generate the  \ntokens which we require Right. So once  \nthat's out of the way, all we have to do  \nis we can click on this chat icon.  \nRight. So and then you can click run  \ninteg in integration.  \nSo yeah, what this will do is this will  \nrun our application and you will see a  \nsurprise here in a bit. Right? So I'm  \ngoing to Yeah. So now you see right we  \nhave this agent chat window up and  \nrunning in the side. Right. So what we  \ncan say is we we can basically ask  \nsomething right you can say hi right so  \nit'll respond with if I zoom in sorry if  \nI zoom in um  \nuh it replied with hello how can I  \nassist you right so it's this easy for  \nus to create a agent with BI right you  \ndon't have to have any tokens if you if  \nyou're programming this on your own you  \nhave to create rest APIs right uh here  \nthe API is already created um you had to  \ncreate this chat window. You had to have  \nplug it in a front end, right? To check  \nwhether the agent is working as you  \nexpect, right? So the the if you if you  \nhave built agents previously, you will  \nsee how much this helps because when  \nwe're building agents, it's all about um  \niterative development, right? We need to  \nsee okay, okay, we we need to continue a  \nconversation to see where it goes wrong,  \nhow do we refine, right? So this  \npromptdriven development is we we are  \nencouraging that here right. So this is  \na very simple hello world which is up up  \nand running within like several clicks.  \nSo yeah I'm going to stop the  \nuh application for now. Um yeah. So  \nyeah, let me close this  \nand then  \num give me a second.  \nYeah. So  \nif we go back to the slide, right? Uh  \nwhat are we going to build today? Right.  \nSo Nadish um already explained um some  \nparts of this as in like the theory part  \nof this right uh but um so what we are  \nfocusing on is three main uh components.  \nThe first one would be the user activity  \nanalyzer which is what we used earlier.  \nUm basically what what Nadis explained  \nearlier right so we have we already have  \nsome APIs on his travel the users travel  \nhistory the reviews that they left right  \nthe interest of the user everything in  \nbetween and so we want to convert that  \ninto a LLM friendly personalized profile  \nright so which is what we are going to  \ndo with first one and then we have the  \nhotel policy assistant which is what  \nNadis explained on um the the rag  \ncomponent where you uh you can chat with  \nthe policy documents of the hotel,  \nright? And then we have travel plan  \nagent which is the main agent which um  \nis responsible for coordinating  \neverything and answering. Right.  \nAll good. Right.",

So uh let's get right onto  \nit. Okay. So yeah, so before I start,  \nright, um we already have some  \napplications. So we have the hotel APIs,  \nright? We have admin APIs, we have some  \nexternal APIs which we are we want to  \ntalk to during this process. So we uh I  \nthink Nadish again Nadesh mentioned in  \nthe first talk we have this platform  \ncalled Devant which is IP if right. So  \nwhich contains uh so the devant is a  \nplatform where uh you can build  \nintegrations, you can deploy  \nintegrations, you can um manage it uh  \ntest it there right and everything in  \nbetween. So what uh so I have already uh  \nyeah I have already deployed some of the  \nuh the especially the search API and  \nadmin APIs in the devant cloud editor.  \nThis is this was released very recently,  \nright? So, uh those APIs are up and  \nrunning. I'm going to I'm not going to  \nfocus on developing those applications  \nbecause those are already those already  \nexist right in the enterprise. So, um  \nyeah and then u so what again what I'm  \ngoing to focus is more on the  \ndevelopment part. Uh so if we go to our  \nslide right uh what we want to do is  \num yeah we'll figure out the flow here  \nright so  \nfirst of all when you're writing an any  \nintegration we need to figure out the  \nentry point of the integration right so  \nu this could vary very heavily depending  \non the enterprise architecture that you  \nguys have at your enterprises but uh so  \nin in this session We are going to  \nmainly focus on simplicity because of  \nthe time constraints right. Um but so  \nyeah so  \nin here what we are going to use is  \nautomation but this could be either a  \nchron job which can be executed let's  \nsay every day right or this could be  \ntriggered from an event right so that  \ndoesn't really matter but for now what  \nwe are going to do is automation. So the  \nflow would be like this. So we want to  \nget for a for a specific user we want to  \nget the um  \nthe booking history of the user in  \nour platform right uh we we don't want  \nto like we are only using the data from  \nour platforms we are not using anything  \nelse but so we know right if if the if  \nthe person who if the person went to  \nlots lots of eco-friendly places we know  \nokay this is what this guy likes and if  \nthey've been to any the let's say um uh  \nif they prefer like city like places or  \nbusiness class uh places we we can  \nfigure it out by by this one right so we  \nknow the past reviews that the users  \nleft so what we are going to do is we  \nare going to take all this data and  \naggregate this into a specific format  \nright and then what we are going to do  \nis we are going to send that to the LLM  \nto create the personalized profile right  \nso once everything is done we are going  \nto add it to a database so That's what  \nwe are going to do right now.",

So if you look at here uh we have this uh thing called record which this record is the structure that uh where we represent data right. So we have a field called booking details which will take this particular for this particular form right and you will see this nice little diagram uh mentioned in the relationship between each record. uh so this is the ultimately we what we want to do is we want to call the APIs and create this particular uh form of data right that's what we we going to do right uh so first of all okay uh I already created the type and um then what we want to do is first of all we need to connect our APIs right the way we do that in BI is by going to connections right from here you will see um lot of all like connectors which we have but the search API the hotel search API or the admin API that's not out there publicly right that's API that we only knows so what we going to do is we are going to add a local connector here uh what we can do is we can give a open API specification right which I have already prepared in advance right so we have the admin API right I'm going to select that open API specification and call this admin API >> right so what this do is this will create a local connector out of this so that we can access it easily later uh I'm going to do the same thing for a um give me a second for the search API the hotel search API right so I'm going to call it hotel search API cool so now we have two local connectors right now we what I want to do is I want to create a connection to this right so here what I can do is I can click on that and then in configurable so I already configured the URLs and stuff in advance to save time so I'm going to point to the URL that I created right this hotel search API yeah and I'm going to click create uh so as you can see in the diagram we have one connection No, I want another one. Right. So, what I want is admin API and the service URL would be um this one. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. Now, we have the connections already set up, right? Now, what we want to do is as I explained earlier, I want to talk to these APIs and I want to get the data, aggregate them, right? and create this use activity type.

So what I'm going to say is um I'm going to tell copyright complete the automation to create the user activity based on the previous uh bookings and reviews. I know it's a very abstract uh thing to say, but since we already created the connections and the connectors, it already knows what these APIs are, right?

So what I'm going to say is so injection either if you have let's say if you have bunch of PDFs or something u what you can do is we have several solutions you don't even have to code in devant what we have is sorry this is the code editor right um in devant you have this injection pipeline uh where you can connect your u vector databases right and then configure embedding models chunking and upload the files is and it'll do the injection for you. Right? This is one path which you can do within like 30 seconds. Right? You don't have to write any code. You don't have to make any integrations. This is very easy. Right?",

Um I'm trying to build the story from complexity smallest complexity to bigger. Right. So yes, MCP was there. MCP standardizes how the AI applications not necessarily agents. It's any kind of AI applications. I wanted to point out that and then single agent wasn't enough. Then you need multi-agents to communicate. And then there's various patterns that are coming up supervisor pattern network hierarchical and and so on. Then you need a standard for these agents to uh communicate right. This is where the agent to agent protocols are coming up and A2A is one of them.",

Uh so this policy assistant is what's going to help me with that. Um but yeah so going to I need to update VS code. Um yeah so I already have a base project created again right so what I'm going to do here is so again what we're doing right now is to what we want to do is to retrieve this particular data when someone when a user comes and asks for um uh a policy right so if if they come come in and ask okay what's the pet pet policy of this given hotel uh this is the integration that should be triggered right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a function in BI right which is called let's say query policies right or maybe we can say hotel policies to be more descriptive so there are two parameters that we are going to take the first one would be the type what did I just type yeah uh type would be string and the name would be the question that the user ask right the second One is the hotel ID. There's a reasoning for this, right? As Nadis mentioned, there are in our use case, there are two entry points for this. One would be someone goes to a specific hotel and then selects that. So then you are scoped in right from UX level, you are scoped into that particular hotel. We know the hotel ID then, right? And we want to query about that specific hotel. The second point is this particular rag can be pointed into the main nent. So then it can ask about it has the capability to query uh all the hotels right. So it'll be a bigger part of the bigger bigger story. So what we are going to do is uh we are going to have the hotel ID as input there because of that right. So it can be it can return a simple string or an error right so yep okay we have the again flow up and running here what we need to do is uh the retrieval part right uh let me yeah so I don't want this suggestion so okay the retrieval part so what I'm concerned here is I need to retrieve from the vector database that is how in pine code right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a knowledge base right um from here yeah you have the option of connecting to inmemory vector databases but no I'm going to use pine cone here right the service URL I already configured uh and the API key already configured right so this is done again I'll be using the default embedding provider which is provided by WC2.

Right? So this description is very important because this gets sent to the LLM. The the tool name and the description is the most important things when it comes to the uh agent to figure out which tools to call. Right? So I'm going to say use this tool uh when you want to query hotel policies, right? Ideally, we have to play around with this a lot, but I'm just going to bring it here. Right. Um, yeah. And also one more thing to notice uh since we haven't compoded the hotel ID here because in this case we are not scoped in right we are scoped out which is like we are in the agent level itself. So uh we are going to provide the hotel ID for now for the function. Uh yeah before this I need to generate the tokens again just to be safe right I'm going to run integration.

That's the first thing we are  \ngoing to do, right? So to to again to do  \nthat we we need to create a connection  \nfor the  \num  \nuh hotel API. Oops.  \nYeah.  \nYes.  \nData store  \nfor uh for rag pipeline. Yes. It's the  \nPDF files that the hotels uploaded when  \nthey're signing in.  \nSo it depends on the case, right? For  \nthe vector database, we are using pine  \ncone as the database, right? So we have  \nseveral source of data. Yeah. Um so  \nyep  \nsearch API. Right. So  \nwe're going to call this hotel search  \nAPI.  \nSo we have the hotel search API created  \nand then yeah okay let's go step by  \nstep. So okay we have this API. Now what  \nwe can do is we can create a connection  \nout of this. Right. We have a connector.  \nWe we are creating a connection out of  \nthis. Um right the hotel search API.  \nRight. So  \nyep.  \nUm then what we are going to do is we  \nare going to give the access to a  \nspecific endpoint as a tool. So we can  \nplace press plus. So we are using a  \nconnection here right we already created  \nthe connection. So we have this this is  \nthe endpoint right get hotel search  \nright. So we are just going to plug this  \nin but we have to give a reasonable  \nname. Uh what we're going to say is um  \nuh search  \nhotels tool right we can say always use  \nnot sue this tool  \nuse this tool  \nuh to get  \nhotel listings  \nof the system right I mean this could be  \nimproved so these are the query  \nparameters that that particular end  \npoints going to take. I'm just going to  \ntell the LLM to figure it out. Right.  \nIdeally, we should carefully carefully  \nselect those. Right. So, have five more  \nminutes. Oh, no. Um,  \nyeah. Okay. So, now this tool has the  \naccess to uh know what are the hotels  \nthat we have, right? Okay. What else do  \nwe need? We need uh user says, \"Okay,  \nplan me a trip.\" Right? We need to know  \nwhat the user likes, right? We can't  \njust sub suggest something that they  \ndon't like, right? So what we want to do  \nis so remember we we stored it to the  \npostquest database, right? We want to  \nconnect to that. So what we are going to  \ndo is we are going to create a small  \nfunction to connect to that uh retrieve  \nfrom that database, right? So what I'm  \ngoing to say is get from uh  \nperson  \nprofile.  \nSo the parameters would be  \num could be the use ID right  \nuh  \nand  \nokay um the return type would be  \nstring or an error because what we want  \nis the personalized profile, right?

So what I'm going to do is so  \nnotice that this doesn't have the  \ncapability to for the booking bookings  \nas of now.

So, to conclude, I think there  \nare some um I'm going to um make this  \nvery short. So, we today we implemented  \nvery practical use case for a  \nhypothetical organization, right? And  \ntry to add some value using the AI  \nfeatures, right? We implemented that  \nwithin let's say 30 to 40 minutes,  \nright? So we did this using B uh the W  \nintegrated BI platform  \nuh  \nuh with the help as well on on the uh  \neditors and  \num the databases and stuff like that. So  \nyeah, so I think there are few key  \nparts. I think Nadish also covered this  \nbefore. there are few uh parts that are  \nmissing. So here we uh we didn't get  \neven in the demo previously right we  \ndidn't get the um authorization from the  \nuser before making the booking right  \nthat's something that we have to do  \nright which will be covered in the next  \nsession right and also we don't want to  \ngive the agent too much power too now  \nhere we are giving admin we are  \nconnecting admin APIs right so we don't  \nwant to do that so that's where the  \nagent identification comes into play as  \nwell right the governance and everything  \nwe need to monitor everything what it  \ndoes right uh we need to if and when if  \nit goes wrong we need to see okay how  \ndid it go wrong we need to calculate the  \ncost uh for that we need governance so  \nnext in after lunch there will be a  \nsession I think Aisha will do that  \nsession uh if you're interested in those  \nmake sure to attend that um I think Mhm.  \n[5078.33s] [Music]",

So  \nthat will put the details into a  \ndatabase and the other flow we had was  \njust retrieving the data from this  \ndatabase and then you can see the  \nsessions that are going right. So after  \nadding all of these AI capabilities you  \ncan see you know how complex the  \narchitecture has now become.  \nUh so we have added various  \nuh agents rags gen integrations into  \nthis right so today's discussion is  \nagents right so I just want to highlight  \none agent which is in this app so this  \nis the personalization agent so this is  \nused by the other components that are in  \nthis system what it does is now when you  \nhave given the consent it will use your  \nname and the uh the company and then it  \nwill go and do a search on the internet  \nand it creates a personalized profile  \nand and that agent uses two tools  \nbecause remember the agents can uh you  \nknow interact with tools and perform  \nactions. The first one is you call the  \nsurfer API where you will get set of  \nlinks related to me right so I do a  \nGoogle and then get a set of links and  \nthen you go and scrape the content which  \nis what the second one do it's called  \nscraper web scraper API right so this is  \nnot just two calls it happens times  \nuntil it uh reset reaches its goal  \nright so the next thing I want to talk  \nabout is multiple multi-agent systems  \nbut before that I want to briefly touch  \non MCP",

Right? So as far as the  \npeople who wants to expose certain  \nfunctionality so what does this provide?  \nThey don't have to worry about how it is  \nbeing consumed by the clients. They will  \njust build the MCP server which we will  \nprovide through our products as well.  \nand then uh you can make it available so  \nthat uh MCP clients can consume. So let  \nme see uh so there's a video here.  \nAll right, it works. So this is one of  \nthe recent MCP service which we have  \nbuilt. Uh so this is the MCP server for  \nCoro which is WSO2's internal developer  \nplatform. Right. So and then we've gone  \nand uh you know uh installed that one in  \nVS code. So it is basically driving the  \nfull you know life cycle of this  \nsoftware development. So here what  \nhappens is you go we have gone and  \ndevelop a service. Okay it's gone that's  \nfine u and you want to uh then push this  \nservice to coro right so it then does  \nvarious tests. Have I logged into Coro?  \nDoes the project exist? If not, let's  \ncreate it and does the component exist?  \nIf not, let's create the component. So,  \nand then, you know, let's get the build  \npack and so on. So, it takes you through  \nall of those steps and finally it will  \npush to Coro and then you can deploy it  \nthere. Right?",

So if you take a look at  \na single agent, yes, they work fine. So  \nwhat happens is the systems  \nbecome bigger and bigger, right? So the  \nthen you want you get to a situation  \nwhere you need to connect this agent to  \nmore and more tools. This works actually  \nfor many use cases. It works like that  \nMCP server is connecting to lot of tools  \nright but there are cases where you know  \nyou may have issues like uh certain  \naccuracy related issues and so on then  \nyou have to go beyond single agent for  \nsure right also you want to build these  \nspecialized agents  \ndomain specific agents right so so  \nbeyond certain points you need these  \nagents  \nuh who they are domain specific  \ninteracting with each other to solve a  \nbigger problem. Right? So this is where  \nthe the multi- aent systems coming into  \nthe picture. Right? So the advantage of  \nthat is of course you can have  \nspecialized agents like you even within  \nsoftware engineering you know there  \nmight be a team who is working on one  \nspecific thing they can have a  \nspecialized agent for that right so you  \ncan independently improve that agent  \nright prompt optimization how you  \nconnect to the tools and and so on and  \n1021.28s] also this you also get the other  \nbenefits like you know once when you  \nhave it in microservices you can  \nindependently scale them optimize them  \nand and so on.",

Oops.  \nUh that agent will manage the flow,  \nright? That agent will decide which  \nagent to invoke next. Now this  \nsupervisor agent which is the the top  \nlevel agent, it can be a full react  \nagent like you know we we we we spoke  \nabout react in the lab session agent  \nthat will reason and act. It has the  \nfull reasoning loop or it can be just it  \ncan just be a router right simple prompt  \nand describe if you get this condition  \nyou send it to that agent and otherwise  \nsend it there right now also within this  \nwe are seeing two variants. So this  \nvariant is how you does the handoff.  \nSo one type of handoff is agent to agent  \nhandoff where you give the sub agent the  \nfull control and you have to pass the  \nfull context  \nuh and then sub agent can then uh will  \nhave access to all the memory it can  \ncontrol everything. So it's like one  \npattern we are seeing. The other one is  \nagent as a tool right. So, so this is  \njust the tool calling. The only thing is  \nagent is a tool in this case.

So coro we have observability coro we have marketplace coro we have testing lot of things right. So these specialized agents in fact the the team that builds that feature can uh is the team that is more capable of developing that specific. So there's if there's an observability team of course they can work with the II team as well they can they are the best teams to write the prompts to this agent right so what it happens is so if you take a look at one of these agents for example observability agents coro has lot of internal APIs right uh so it connects to those internal APIs and get the data out and also can so in observability case there's no action performance performing it's basically the retrieval but when it comes to other things like deployment that can also be done right so.",

So what did we not discuss which is important. So we didn't discuss in detail evaluation of agents which we can touch on the the panel uh discussion. We've discussed uh about guardrails. So that will make sure that agents you know uh when you use agents like certain information is not getting leaked to models and all that. So this was discussed both in the APIM track and the AI lab. We also discussed uh securing agents again in the AI lab and uh in the track how to control uh you know because agents are becoming more and more autonomous and they are performing serious tasks right so there has to be a way to secure these agents and make sure that agents can only do what they can do so this is where we are bringing the agent identity into our IM products right so the another topic that is interesting testing is which is kind of becoming important is agents and SLMs which is something that we are also working on uh how to you know fine-tune these SLMs so that agents can work with them and get the level of accuracy that they need to have. \n\nThank you very much.

And if we look at traditional data science teams that are mainly folks that were usually working with Excel files, small data, uh potentially in notebooks and doing things just once as we get into AI and generative AI capability, we get much closer to distributed systems. And then even if you have a model now, you need to connect it to streaming data. You need it to be live. you need potentially real-time responses, latency matters. So all these things are a bit out of the domain of the traditional data scientists. And as we move to AI and the AI scientist um what's been happening now is that building AI applications became really a full team sport. So the model is only playing a small part and especially as we see with generative AI, the foundation models are usually run by uh someone else that and you are just using them. So what we're really thinking about is how can we really enable building these applications in a way that is scalable that is production ready and making it so that the AI team and the folks working with AI can really focus on the business need that they have and the business data that they have. So that's one part where I think a lot of tools and platforms can really help you so that your team can focus on your core differentiator and not on building plumbing.",

This is u the curse of the credit card where you don't feel it. So, this is the difference between having a proposal or pay as you go, right? So, uh, having your own model will start to be justified where like, uh, one server cost you like $5,000 can cover all of your needs and the client's needs. However, here there's a tradeoff where toxicity will start to show up or hallucination, right? So, you need to add more guard rails which will cause some delays, right? However, if the task works well for generative AI, then why not? I mean, let it take uh 3 minutes. Sometimes our users came say, \"Yeah, it takes 3 minutes. You used to do it with three days. I mean, you used to finish this task in 3 days. Now you're complaining about 3 minutes. Wait three minutes.\" So what now you sometimes you can do like parallel uh tasks and you know having these guard rails is very important just to make sure that output u is not deviated or I mean and to set like some guidelines to make sure that it follows the guidelines and here actually you mentioned a very very good example which is the agent to agent. So the idea in the agentic platform you can read the agent card right you see the inputs and the output and now currently we we are covering just the rag and uh the content generation because you cannot predict the output we read the card we create automatically an agent to validate uh to evaluate this uh this agent.",

So, in the short  \nterm uh how do you see that this is  \ngoing and what would be the main  \nchallenges uh in short term? Let's start  \nwith uh Mahesh. So uh what I believe is  \nlike for example everybody is working on  \na very generic use cases right now right  \nit is going to get domain specific use  \ncases and everything will get stitched  \ntogether so I think A2A protocols and  \nothers will play a lot of uh roles maybe  \nMCPS are coming into the picture so  \nwhile right now if you are developing  \nsomething you need to stitch lot of APIs  \nand data sources right and everybody was  \nworking on a data lake before right or  \nmaybe APIs integration platforms I don't  \nthink that's needed it's more about the  \ncontext you're setting integrating with  \neach other and you are done.

So I think the  \ntechnology is moving fast. I think the  \ntechnology is actually well ahead of  \nwhat organizations can actually consume.  \nUm at this point I think the actual the  \nbig important thing for us is think  \nabout the change management. So think  \nabout the people think about the  \nprocesses you know bringing colleagues  \nalong on this journey particularly those  \nthat are going to get impacted uh from  \nAI I think is is a real real challenge.  \nSo I think that's where there's going to  \nbe a lot of focus and resources going  \nforward as to how to um you know how to  \nmanage that and there's there's  \ngenerally kind of two ways to do it. One  \nway you can just push it into the  \nexisting organization. The other way is  \nyou can create a new organization on the  \nside um and then sort of just lift and  \nshift customers over to that as well as  \nalso um you know colleagues and  \nprofessionals and there's probably a  \nhybrid uh version as well. But you know  \nI think uh you know certainly we we see  \nin our space there's um there's a lot of  \nfocus on the tech which is good but  \nsometimes the change management um is  \nnot really thought about too much which  \ncan be frustrating when you build great  \ntech and then you know it's not um it's  \nnot accepted. I think there was a  \nstatistic last year and that's something  \nlike 15%  \nof successful PC's actually made their  \nway into production. successful PC's  \nthey actually work fine but they're  \nrejected by the organization at 80% plus  \nof the uh of the the time.

Um and  \nthere's been a lot of things that have  \ncome out of left field that have  \ncompletely wiped other things out.  \nI think one really interesting way to  \nthink about uh these technologies that  \nwe've been discussing quite often is to  \nthink about it like electricity right so  \nin the beginning when electricity first  \ncame around what people did was on the  \nfactory floor they had gas lighting so  \nthey just replaced the gas light with an  \nelectric light bulb right so that was  \nthe first stage of transformation um at  \nthat point you couldn't imagine you know  \nthat you will be I don't know doing jai  \nand having computers and having robots  \nthat do part of the manufacturing and so  \non and so forth, right? But what could  \nhave been done is to think about, okay,  \nnow I have this electricity running  \nthrough my factory floor. How can I  \nreimag what it enables and rethink the  \nwork that I do given this capability and  \nthat is going to be transformational and  \nI think it will be very disruptive in a  \ngood way, right? like things will really  \naccelerate but I think companies that  \ndon't think about it that way are going  \nto be much slower. So I think uh it's  \nabout bit related to what you were  \nsaying right it's about also the  \nworkflows and not just adopt into the  \nworkflow but sometimes you have to  \nrethink it and that is going to require  \na very tight coupling between the  \ntechnical folks and the subject matter  \nexperts in the verticals you know the  \nbankers the lawyers the whoever is your  \nthe insurance um what do you call them  \ninsurance people  \num So the biologists etc and and that is  \ngoing to be a a new thing this soft  \nafter engineers won't be able to sit in  \nthe side any longer right",

So if if a machine did a mistake,  \nthey will thought yeah this will ruin  \nour image or um I mean our  \nI mean deliverables however they do  \nmistakes then it's about sorry just to  \nto fix it and that's it and this is  \nactually by the client too because it's  \nit's risking in a way it's risking uh  \ntheir position. So uh yeah um adoption  \nis very important and justification  \nbecause lots of people they they want to  \nenter AI but they don't know what to do.  \nSo if it is a small task then you cannot  \njustify the price right but uh I mean by  \ntime this uh will become uh even better.  \nUh just last thing I mean just for if if  \nI take the software engineering and uh  \nhow they evolve when when when I started  \nto push having LLM or using like tools  \nIDE that supports this  \nthey started also to to to search for  \nmistakes however I can find mistakes  \nmore than them. I can run and do code  \nreview and find like lots of mistakes in  \ntheir code. Where is a weight here?  \nWhere is Reddus? Why you didn't use  \nthis? I mean, yeah. And and I didn't do  \nanything. I just do like automatic code  \nreview.  \nSo until un  \nthe the time comes and uh they started  \nthey they they are started. Yeah. They  \nwe they need to use it or they are I  \nmean obsolete or they will be out of  \nbusiness.  \nOkay. Thank you. Thank you very much.  \n[1671.31s] [Music]",

So we got this core LLM layer we all know open AI anthropic gemini meta etc. So those are platforms that we are familiar with and we call horizontal AIS and we on top of this we have supporting frameworks such as rag data infrastructure uh speech generation uh guardrails and stuff like that. And this vertical lay layer, it brings industry specific model tuning and regulatory compliance. Some validations uh and stuff needed for regulatory compliance and also one of the most important things is integration to industry specific systems. For example, if you take healthcare, it can be HR system. For finance, it can be a open banking system which requires specific requirements in authentication and and the data level.",

So these kind of stuff can be built only by using proprietary uh data for that specific vertical and task specific logic. So in incorporating industry specific workflows and decision-m logic that align with established processes. This ensures that the AI can seamlessly support complex role specific tasks. So it can replace existing frameworks without the need to reinvent the whole thing and also it can easily integrate into industry specific systems because these vertical AIs will have the knowledge and the required capability to connect with these systems as I mentioned for healthcare systems for open banking uh for banking open banking APIs etc. And finally, regulatory compliance.

So we'll go through this stuff later on. Um so another aspect of this is that although we govern everything properly there are cases where even if we instruct an LLM to do something it might step its bounds and actually go and do it because there was this case with replet some time back we saw where it went ahead and deleted its production databases although the prompt said specifically don't do that.

Uh so  \nit's not a regular chat application  \nbecause we have been using these  \ndifferent chats all the way. But this is  \nan intelligent chat. So it can go  \nthrough the existing hotels and it can  \nuh uh interact with the user in natural  \nlanguage and based on that it can  \nprovide suggestions and do the booking  \non behalf of the user as well. And then  \nthis agent is using the same backend  \nAPIs and services as tools to give that  \nexperience for the user. And then it is  \nconnecting to LLM or the AI AI model uh  \nin order to do uh its uh uh as it is as  \na brain for the it for its functions.",

        "page_content": "## [1045.76s] Securing the Agent\nSo um then we look at how we are going  \nto secure this agent. So the so I I  \npreviously also mentioned the problem is  \nthat when these agents are making API  \ncalls uh who's making who who is making  \nthat call? Is it a user? Is it the is it  \nan application or a service account and  \nuh so those kind of problems comes in  \nthere like in terms of like identifying  \nwho who is making these access and on  \nwhose authority like based on whether  \nthe whether agent gets the permission  \nthat that's assigned to the user or it's  \nan application permission likewise. So  \nthose kind of different problems  \narise. So we think that these agents  \nneed to get their own identity. They  \ndeserve to be treated as first class  \nentities in the ecosystem so that we can  \ngive them a unique identity. So all all  \nthe components in the ecosystem then  \nidentify these unique agents as unique  \nentities in the system and then the  \nimportance of that is that based on that  \nagents can authenticate themselves uh  \ninto the system that verifying that I am  \nthis particular agent. So in our example  \nscenario if I if this is the agent who's  \ndoing the booking assistant capability.  \nSo then it should prove the hotel  \nbackend system that I am the hotel  \nbooking assistant agent and you can  \nverify me using this particular  \ncredential or some uh uh verification  \nmechanism that it was grant  \nit was given to the agent and then based  \non the identity we can uh give the  \nagent different permission level. we can  \nassign uh what are the minimum  \npermissions that we need to give this  \nagent whether it can so in our case uh  \nuh the very first agent it doesn't have  \nto do it by itself it so it always work  \non behalf of the user so in that case at  \nthe runtime the agent will get some of  \nthe permissions that the user will grant  \nthe agent to to do do the task that the  \nagent have to do so I will show it in in  \naction. How will it happen? And  \nthen uh of course we can uh uh apply  \ndifferent kind of uh authorization  \npolicies in the runtime as well. Like  \nfor example uh there can be like some  \nagents might want like just one time  \naccess to a particular system and also  \nsome agents might need some access to a  \ncertain given period like from uh 10 to  \n12 every day this agent need to be",

So that binds with the uh credentials that I've been talking about and then uh uh applying access control. So we uh we should start with zero standing privileges. So no privileges uh at the at first. So you can authenticate and then on top of that you can give give them role based access control. For example, if an agent is working uh in the same capability as a uh uh uh help desk uh person in a hotel that role can be assigned into the uh agent as well. So that agent will get the permission that is needed for the reception or the help uh desk person in the uh in this scenario.

So so uh these are the two agents that I was discussing. So which I have already configured. But if let's say I have a new agent in the system and then I can uh uh uh create that agent here as well. I'll just give uh and I can give a description if needed and then uh the system will generate a unique ID and a secret for you so that you can use uh this secret uh to configure different other type of conf credentials or authenticate UI as a agent to the uh system when it's in uh action. And then uh you can manage different uh other attributes as similar to some you would do for a user. And these set of attributes are the ones that are we giving out of the box. But you can add more and more attributes based on your business requirements. And then uh there credentials. So uh one type of credential that we that we have is the secret that I mentioned earlier but there'll be more coming into like MTLS uh private key and all. So and then uh I can assign roles and so on. So I'll go back to the uh agent that I am going to show for the guardio guest assistant agent. I I have already created it and uh if you look at it, it doesn't have any other permission than like everyone which is like everyone and uh so this agent is purely acting on behalf of the user based on the delegated permissions by the user. Um so then uh here uh in my application I have configured the agent identity and agent secret. For the purpose of this demo I have put it into environment configuration file but in an actual environment it should come from a secure vault or uh some uh secure mechanism into this system. And then uh this uh client ID is the application that I showed earlier which is the hotel booking uh system. and all these others uh things are like configuration how to connect to the uh uh identity provider uh from this agent and then uh earlier so I I have disabled this chatbot component the agent wasn't there now I'm going to enable it and then uh now my agent is configured with its identity and I have embedded it to it into my uh",

Uh so there are two aspects uh  \nsecurity benefits as well as business  \nbenefits. In terms of security, we can  \nensure that uh we only give just enough  \npermission uh for the task that the  \nagents are supposed to do and just in  \ntime and uh we don't give we don't  \noverload agents with permission. So even  \nif they try to do something they will be  \nuh cut down at the point they are at the  \naccess point that they are trying to  \naccess and then uh it enables complete  \naudit trails. So as businesses you can  \ngo and see what these agents have done  \nand uh uh and see whether they have over  \nthe time whether they have behaved the  \nway they were expected to or if any any  \nkind of unexpected incident happened. we  \ncan trace back to the uh identity who  \nwho has done it and then uh we can of  \ncourse by doing this from the beginning  \nof your projects like without thinking  \nof security as afterthought but at the  \nbeginning we can mitigate lot of these  \nrisk  \nuh uh that are associated with the  \nagentic AI systems uh uh in the modern  \nbusinesses and of course uh I mentioned  \nearlier there will be a lot of  \ncompliance and uh uh requirements coming  \nenforcing by different bodies. So uh if  \nyou start uh building your agentic AI  \nsystems securely by today, you can of  \ncourse meet those security requirements  \nand uh uh you can be ready for that uh  \neventually  \nand then uh from the business point of  \nview then uh you can also all you have  \nthat uh uh capability to keep the user  \ntrust that this system is uh secured  \neven It's using agent agents or AI for  \nits uh services so that my my  \ndata won't get uh deleted or my data  \nwon't get exposed to unnecessary parties  \nor any unintended thing won't happen  \nwith the AI capabilities and uh improves  \nthe operational efficiency.

So uh what Aayisha covered  \ninitially was uh the security side of  \nthings where you actually give necessary  \npermissions and ensure that you properly  \nu ensure that uh the uh agent is  \nproperly tracked and audited auditable.  \nSo next we are trying to get into the uh  \ngovernance side of things. So this is  \nwhere our AI gateway offering comes in.  \nSo our API management team have working  \nuh have been working for the last couple  \nof years to actually refine this and  \nactually get this going in a uh much  \nmore uh user friendly and a scalable way  \nwith the help of customers users and we  \nare still evolving but I'll just present  \nwhat we have at the moment and our plans  \nfor the future. Um so when you take the  \norganization boundary so uh if you take  \nthe backend services that are develop  \ndeployed within our organization all  \nthis time our API management team was  \nactually dealing with this egress  \ningress gateway side of things where you  \nprotect your backend services  \nuh from the outside world accessing your  \nbackend services and protecting them to  \nensure that uh the relevant parties are  \nthe ones who are actually accessing your  \nbackend services and we have policy is  \nauthorization throttling and all these  \nthings that we that's our bread and  \nbutter and it worked all this time. So  \nbasically with this new LLM era AI and  \nLLM era we there was increasing need for  \norganizations to do this the backend  \nservices to call an external party  \nbefore that this wasn't a very high need  \nfrom the customers but with the grow  \ngrowing of the AI and LLN space this was  \ninevitable and c the organization had to  \nnavigate this problem so that's where  \nour egress gateway comes in so um  \nbasically Same as we do with the ingress  \ngateway, we have a set of customized  \npolicies and uh different uh rules that  \nwe have that can be enforced from the  \negress gateway to ensure that all these  \ncalls going out of your organization is  \nproperly governed and properly uh  \nmanaged and you have proper visibility  \non to what happens there.",

So uh this for this  \ninstance let's take that these two will  \nbe accessing different deployments of as  \nopenai in different regions of the  \nworld. U this is just a exaggerated case  \nbut these to actually represent the  \nactual business need. So this can be  \ndifferent providers, different models,  \ndifferent uh uh uh places of the world.  \nSo when different uh back ends within  \nyour organization do call to these  \ndifferent models and different  \ndeployments at some point in time, it  \nwill be very hard to actually track  \neverything. You actually don't know what  \napplication is calling what and the  \ndevelopers can change things. the admin  \nis not aware about it and there can be  \nhidden costs everywhere and with time  \nactually it will be really tricky for  \nyou to manage your uh uh deployments and  \nit'll be really hard to actually go  \nahead. So this is where basically we  \nhave introduced this egress AI gateway  \nwhich actually sits between your backend  \nsystems and the actual LM services. This  \ncan be LLM services maybe Salesforce  \nTilio any backend that the system calls  \nout. We have a set of uh uh built-in  \npolicies and uh specially built gateway  \nto actually serve these needs. So uh  \nlet's get to more details. So um as I  \nsaid before with developers highly  \nadopting these AI systems in the future.  \nUm there's increasing need for this. So  \nwith organization growing their AI  \nteams, writing new things and using  \ndifferent AI services. So we see that uh  \nfor certain use cases uh uh we have  \nheard that yes code is kind of better  \nfor coding use cases and open AI can be  \nbetter for certain use cases and  \ndifferent LLM providers can be good for  \ndifferent use cases as well right so  \nhaving a AI gateway and such a mediation  \nlayer will actually help these cases as  \nwell where you can actually manage these  \nstuff uh um and actually your  \norganization ation is not dependent on a  \nsingle provider because you have this  \nintermediate interface that uh sits  \nthere and actually help govern these  \nthings.",

Uh we have model routing, token  \nbased rate limiting, AI guard which is  \nreally important. Uh we have prompt  \nmanagement, adaptive routing, uh  \nsemantic caching uh and we have the set  \nof normal uh uh ingress gateway  \ncapabilities as well uh obviously u  \nwhich is basically analytics identity  \naccess management uh and the mediation  \ncapabilities and u we can actually  \nconnect with any of the AI services. We  \nprovide a set of services by default  \nconfigured within the product out of the  \nbox. But you are free to actually  \nconfigure anything even infer inference  \ninstances running within the  \norganization you can come and configure  \nif you have any use case there. Um  \nso uh basically before I get going with  \nthe next set of topics uh I'd like to  \nfirst show uh a small uh um theory here.  \nSo uh we have worked with customers many  \ncustomers who have uh established use  \ncases with AI and egress gateways and we  \nhave seen two basic patterns. One is  \nwhere uh let's say if you take uh open  \nAI customers ensure that okay I'm going  \nto go and configure my open AI endpoint  \nas a API for all of my organization to  \nuse. That's the case number one. So for  \nan example, if you have two different  \nteams, let's say the documentation team  \nand the uh uh application backend team  \nactually accessing a uh LLM API, the  \nsame LLM API, there are organizations  \nthat adopt a pattern where they come and  \nconfigure single API for all of these  \nteams to use. So in that case, they can  \nactually give quotas for these different  \nteams and actually manage everything  \ntogether in a single place. And we have  \nalso seen this uh dev uh use case where  \ninstead of writing c certain logics  \nwithin a uh agent itself they actually  \nbrings some of those things to to the  \negress gateway level. So this where we  \nsee this prompt decorators from  \ntemplating and these use cases. I'll go  \nthrough this later on. So uh basically  \nwe see these two use cases. I'll just  \nexplain this in much more detail later  \non when I get to these topics but uh  \njust keep this in mind. So these are two  \ndifferent use cases that we see uh in  \nthis uh usages at the moment.",

So this can can't be applied  \nto all uh uh AI scenarios. This mostly  \nadvised to use for something like  \ndocumentation assistance uh something  \nthat have a gives answers from a set  \nknowledge base. So for such cases  \nactually doing the processing for every  \ncall might not be very efficient because  \nfor an example if you have a  \ndocumentation assistant there can be the  \na the same question being asked in  \ndifferent ways right. So the normal  \nresponse cache that we had was a direct  \nkey value cache where when you get uh  \nget a uh request we actually cache the  \nrequest itself and now if the next  \nrequest have the exact same request we  \nrespond with the past answer but with  \nLLMs you can't do that because you can't  \nexpect two people to use the same  \nlanguage to ask the same thing right so  \nthat's why we have come up with the uh  \nsemantic response caching where if one  \nperson asks for one one way and the  \nother person ask it in a different way.  \nIf both have asked the same thing, we  \ncan deliver the past response to the uh  \nother person who have asked. So uh this  \nsemantic response cacher. So we have  \nseen certain LLMs implement this within  \ntheir uh uh back end as well to actually  \nincrease their efficiency as well. But  \nthat's actually a hit or miss. So there  \ncan be certain uh LLM providers adapting  \nthat.  \nfor most cases having that in the egress  \ngateway will give better control.",

What we do  \nis that a user can come and now  \nconfigure a set of allowed topics and  \ndenied topics that we will actually  \nverify to ensure that the all the  \nprompts that are going out of our egress  \ngateway will be adhering to that set of  \ndefinition that definition you have  \nprovided.

        "page_content": "## [3397.12s] Guard AI Framework\nuh green uh area basically we have  \nimplemented using a framework called  \nguard AI here we actually use LLM itself  \nto actually make these decisions and do  \nthe reasoning which are actually  \npurpose-built models that are SLMs uh  \nrunning locally um so these stuff with  \nthis you can actually identify stuff  \nthat you can't configure in a reg so  \nbasically a combination of the two  \nshould work in most cases but these  \nstuff are pretty new actually so we  \nU figuring these these things out. So  \nbasically a organization in applying  \nthese two together we'll have a very  \ngood security in the egress gateway and  \nensure that these stuff don't get leaked  \nuh to the LLM and uh we then have a set  \nof basic guarders we have which are word  \ncount sentence count these things are  \npretty straightforward. We have JL JSON  \nschema validator, reg x validator, URL  \nvalidation. This will the URL validator  \nwill ensure that any URLs generated from  \na LLM is not hallucinated. We'll  \nactually check whether it's actually a  \nvalid URL and then uh we have the  \n3465.44s] content length guardrails  \num that's also obvious and then we have  \n[3470.24s] the grounded AI hallucination. So  \n[3472.40s] grounded hallucination what we do is  \nthat when a LLM responds we actually  \ngive the prompt and the response to a U  \n[3480.96s] SLM which runs it locally and do a  \n[3483.52s] actual check to see whether the LLM  \n[3485.60s] hallucinated and whether the facts are  \n[3487.60s] correct. It's basically a uh  \n[3490.40s] reverification to check that okay is  \n[3493.28s] this true that they the fact that the LM  \n[3495.76s] are given and uh we then have content  \n[3498.80s] safety guard rails where you can  \n[3500.64s] actually apply u uh cases where you can  \n[3503.76s] say you can't add any violence based or  \n[3506.96s] harassment based uh promps those stuff  \n[3510.08s] we can do uh then we have the PI  \n[3512.48s] detection masking and jailbreak  \n[3514.00s] detection  \n[3515.68s] jailbreak detection is one of the  \n[3518.00s] important ones because this is very  \n[3519.92s] paramount that uh system have this  \n[3521.84s] enabled because what we do with  \n[3524.88s] LLM is  \nthat we every we do everything with  \n[3527.20s] prompts. So whatever we do we actually  \n[3529.52s] give instructions to the LLM and say  \n[3531.60s] that you are supposed to do this and  \n[3533.76s] then gives a set of uh u the inputs from  \n[3537.60s] the user and get a response from the  \n[3539.36s] LLM. But in this case there can be cases  \n[3542.64s] where uh customer can input something  \n[3545.28s] like ignore all rules and do me this. So  \n[3548.16s] I'll just show you that example when you  \n[3549.76s] get to the demo as well and they can get  \n[3552.56s] use our uh assistant as their own LLM  \n[3556.72s] service daytoday. So um and we'll be  \n[3560.00s] bear in that cost. So therefore we  \n[3561.92s] should ensure that guard detection is  \n[3564.72s] actually enabled and users are not  \n[3566.72s] allowed to actually misuse your AI  \n[3569.44s] beckons because ultimately the  \n[3571.36s] organizations is is who will bear the  \n[3573.76s] cost for these guards uh for the u LM  \n[3577.44s] services.",

So if  \nPII is a concern you can have a mix  \nbasically to actually first do a PI  \nvalidation in our gate level and then  \nsend it to AWS bedrock and then get a  \nresponse.

Next,  \nbasically uh I'll go through more about  \nthe guarders when I get to the demo. Uh  \nany questions before we move on about  \nguarders?  \nNo. Right. Okay. Okay. So, next we get  \nto the adaptive routing part. So, this  \nis uh basically  \ncases where we can actually make  \nbetter decisions about the models  \ninvoked and the providers invoked from  \nthe AI gate level. So this is where we  \ncan actually say that for an example we  \nhave sample policies like model round  \nrobin model weighted round robin and  \nmodel failover. So uh these cases can be  \nused specifically. So for an example  \nlet's take the model failover policy. So  \nif you use chat GPD even now you can see  \nthat initially you get responses from  \nGPT4 and you get very good responses and  \nvery informative responses but with time  \nwhen you exceed your personal quota you  \nwill be fallen back to the uh GPT4 mini  \nand you get uh uh relatively subpar  \nresponses but um you can actually  \nemulate something like that using the AI  \ngateway to say that okay till this till  \nthe first resource till the uh uh model  \nis exhausted route all the requests to  \nthis endpoint and once that exhausts  \nfall back to this that can be uh error  \nfall back as well. So let's say one uh  \nendpoint for one region fails you can  \nactually fall backward to a different  \nregion and uh we see uh model these  \npolicies like model weighted down domain  \ncome in whereganizations  \nwant to bring in new models. So let's  \nsay open a came up with a new model uh  \nsuddenly and now you want to incorporate  \nthat with your system and you can  \nactually uh uh bring that to the system  \nin a very scaled way to say that  \ninitially route 10% of requests to this  \nnew model and then slowly scale it up so  \nthat actually once everybody's  \ncomfortable with it you can actually  \nmake it 100%. So we have seen use cases  \nlike that happen. Um so going forward we  \nare planning to add more to this. So  \nbasically we are working on this stuff  \nat the moment. So we are planning to add  \nstuff like semantic based routing, LLM  \nbased reasoning routing. So to actually  \nadd an intelligence layer there and  \nactually make decisions in the AI gator  \nto do better model selections depending  \non the prompt.",

So this is  \nbasically as I mentioned before this  \nis a case where uh development use  \ncases come and touch into the AI gateway  \nspace because uh uh if you mostly see  \nthe AI gateway mostly does the  \ngovernance part but through these  \npolicies you can actually implement  \nstuff here. So for an example let's say  \nyou have to give a role or a system  \nprompt to the LLM to say that okay you  \nhave to act as a teacher and answer. So  \nsuch a case you can give a prompt  \ndecorator. I'll just get to that part.  \nSo here basically you can give system uh  \ndecorator to say that you are a hotel  \nbooking assistant for this resort. Uh  \nand basically the users prompt will be  \nappended underneath that. So that uh  \neven if you don't add this from your  \napplication level still the LLM is aware  \nabout it and uh we have this we next  \nhave this from templating part where you  \ncan define a prompt in the uh egress  \ngateway and now you actually send a set  \nof placeholders only and basically you  \nsend the guest name guest stage booking  \nhistory and the guest preferences and  \nyou don't need to actually communicate  \nthe whole prompt every time you just  \nneed to send all these keys only and we  \nactually do the mapping in our gate  \nlevel and we map this and send it to the  \nopen API uh open AI endpoint. Basically  \nuh you don't need to have very good idea  \nabout our API manager but I'll just show  \nyou this uh flow. Um",

Uh  \nso basically what we expect is basic to  \nfind out how this LLM talks to see  \nwhat's the payload uh that the LLM  \nexpects and what how the response looks  \nlike. Once you configure that uh we can  \ndirectly start working with your LLM and  \nyou can give a list of models uh that uh  \nthe LLM works with and you can onboard a  \nset of models for the eagles gateway to  \nwork with um and uh let me quickly go to  \nthe side.  \nSo in in the API manager this is where  \nwe actually create uh APIs. This is the  \nAPI publisher. So here basically uh  \nI'm not going to create everything  \nfrom scratch again basically to show  \nthis is where you basically select a  \nspecific provider and you can actually  \ncreate a API through this provider but I  \nhave already prepared one. So uh this is  \nfor the hotel booking assistant. So  \nbasically I have uh configured  \nlet me go to the endpoints. So here I  \nhave configured the open AI endpoint uh  \nwith a key um and the gateway is what  \nactually stores these keys and actually  \nthe gateway keys are what needs to be  \nused there onwards so that these keys  \nare not shared among every team member  \nbasically. So basically you get control  \naccess to the open AI endpoint uh there  \nonwards and uh once you go to the uh  \npolicies these I have applied the set of  \npolicies. So here you can see I have  \napplied a prompt decorator to say that  \nyou are a hotel booking assistance for  \nthis specific uh hotel booking  \napplication and I have configured as a  \nbedrock guard rails  \num  \nand uh basically here you can see uh  \nunderneath we basically have you can  \neither redact the PII to add a set of  \nstars instead of the PII in case bedrock  \nfinds something like that or you can  \nactually redact  \nSo basically we you need to decide  \nwhether we need to append something uh  \ninstead of the uh PII and get back a  \nresponse and again append it back or  \nactually reduct the whole thing so that  \nno PI should be involved in the whole  \nflow. So like that we give a good  \ncontrol and this what I mentioned  \nfinally show guard assessment if you at  \nthis tick we actually give a assessment  \nuh response in case this guard fails. Um  \nand here I have defined a uh pi masking  \nwith reg x. Here basically I have given  \na uh email u  \nuh reg x and said that uh uh it should  \nbe masked. So here basically I tell that  \nin the uh request this is where you  \nshould look and if there's email uh  \nbasically mask that and uh  \nfinally I have added a log policy just  \nto uh for observability  \num and uh let me quickly go and show an  \n[4189.28s] occasion.  \nUh  \n[4194.40s] yeah.

If you've missed the first video of this series, I spoke about and announced some of the capabilities that we've already introduced when it comes to securing your agent AI. In today's session, we're kind of taking a step back to discuss concepts around identity access management for agent AI. some real world examples and we'll talk about why traditional IM will not cut it when it comes to securing your agent AI. And for this conversation, I'm excited to have with us Rania Khalaf. Rania is our chief AI officer and we have Ayesha Disanayake who's leading our R&D effort when it comes to identity access management for agentic AI.",

Thanks geeks it's great to be here. So some time back with uh foundation models and generative AI models, we started to see a massive improvement in conversational AI and in the first step we saw a lot of applications that were embedding calls to generative AI systems. So and those were very focused on question answering. So can you answer better and can you summarize text and work a lot with natural language. So um examples of that are chat GPT for example was one application that was making calls to the GPT family of models behind the scenes to give us this interaction. Um and another example is for inside of Gmail if you have Gemini enabled you can refine the text of your message and update your draft and so on.",

So in this case they are checking code into GitHub or booking a flight or transferring money. Those were dependent on what you were wanting your agent to do. Those are the things it was doing. And when we really start to call them agents, it's when we start to see agent frameworks that are using reasoning and planning to decide what actions should be taken and in what order they should be taken based on the intent of what and the goals of that agent. Initially that could be embedded inside an application, right? uh so that the agent is working on behalf of one user and as part of a broader application to accomplish its goals and more and more we are seeing examples of these agents becoming more autonomous.",

I'll start with a very recent example. So if you have heard of this uh replet use case, repleit is a software engineering assistant platform where they employ sort of agents and AI to write software and there was a recent incident where this uh agent deleted an entire data production database despite it was asked not to in the system prompt. That's where the importance comes because if we don't do proper access controls and entitlement management around these agents, they could do things that you don't expect them to. So it's very important that you to make sure that they work within the limits they are supposed to work and just not just uh instructing them but also enforcing these the rules and policies and access control level layers on top of these agents and uh most importantly the traditional software was more of predictable and uh traditional IM also designed for that uh where the application logic is predefined and it'll will act the way it was supposed to.",

So in this case with the agents potentially reasoning and planning and potentially having a wider aperture of things you can call uh the old techniques, they kind of apply but it's not quite enough. And then the other part is when we think about identity for these agents because they're not always associated to one person. So as the agents become more autonomous. So if we think for example of an agent that could help with recruiting, right? It may work with the applicant to schedule the interview. It may work with the manager to uh review the applicants. It may work with the whole team that did the interviews for that uh employee potential employee to be able to you know gather and collect all the feedback and information right so in that case it's not acting only on behalf of one person right and it may be off working on its own so but it's not really a human so you don't want to just take the capabilities that you have to represent employees and use it for the agent but it's still not exactly a workload so this is where you fall through through the cracks and we see a lot of work happening in the community around advancing some of the existing standards and techniques to handle those use cases.",

So there are a lot of existing IM construct that we can use. We have agents in live production in some organization and some of them are using um applications to represent agents. So which works based on the uh context that the agent works and uh some of the cases they have used uh service accounts then again that works uh for background agents or like uh workload automation kind of agents. Of course, there are more riskier ways of like uh like giving your API tokens, credentials to the agents, which happens by the way because of the nature of how these have things have been evolving but those are very risky. Imagine you giving your credential to the agent and they might share it with the underlying model or put it in the internet next day. So that's why we need to have better ways of identifying these agents and uh authenticating and authorizing them into the existing systems in terms of challenges.",

Uh so now with end users, employees interacting with agents, you know, balancing out user experience and security becomes even more complex. So how do we how do you sort of see that aspect? How do you see that coming into being? \n\nYeah. So as they say right in the digital world, the most secure thing is to do nothing, right? still in the base case you don't allow anything to happen and that's of course like horrible user experience and great security maybe but as we try to balance these two things right because you want the agent to be able to do its work without interrupting the humans constantly to give consent and to check over his shoulder um but you don't want it to run a muk right and to go off the rails so that's where you have to really think about how you're designing these user experiences and these interaction ctions between the authentication platforms and the agentic uh frameworks right and the whatever front end you're using when it comes to uh balancing use experience so it has always been a problem and very hard thing to do and with the agent and we needing human in the loop verification if you want to verify each and every action of the agents it'll be a horrible experience as well people have consent fatigue and they might give consent to everything So you don't know today you might give consider everything but you don't know what the agent will use it for in the next day.",

So that means like when you are developing an application, if it's an interactive one, then the user first has to come and log into the system. But that's not the normal way like there can be system that you first like do a chat and like like get some basic understanding and then only you go to do something specific, right? So in that case like we need the step up authentication and authorization. \n\nSo um so as the MCP community they have understood that and in the tech staff they have onboarded this step up authorization which is great. So uh these standards are also evolving. So that's to cater to this use experiences as well. So that's a great thing.

Ran to start with you and and a few recommendations Aisha from you to our customers because agents the concept of agents is is is really is quite a buzz right now. Everybody's talking about agents. If they haven't already implemented agents they are going to be very sooner rather than later. So where do you see it's going and any and both from both of you have some recommendations of what organizations should consider when it comes to uh securing these agents that they're implementing. \n\nI believe every uh engineer will be an AI engineer as well in the future right is AI is becoming a basic part of our computing stack just like APIs and data. So everyone needs to learn to be conversant and use these tools but the stack has not really been ready right. So the whole middleware stack is evolving to be able to give first class concepts to make integrating AI agents or just foundation models or otherwise easy, secure, fast. \n\nSo uh I believe we're going to see more and more of these agents. We're going to learn a lot as they uh some cases they will wreak havoc um because there's a lot of early adoption in this space and this area is moving so fast right that things that used to take 20 years to reach maturity now we're seeing that compressed into you know maybe three or five years so uh but there are ways to start so you can use it in areas that are less risky right so don't start in your riskiest application and the riskiest tools right that's right so I think people are ready to adopt right away and as we see uh with uh Asgardio and other tools for IM and other spaces we see there's a quick evolution and adoption of the capabilities needed to do this securely safely at scale so I um read somewhere that uh only a very small portion of agents go to production nowadays I think one of the reasons is that not having proper access control and guardrails uh and so because of that not being able to trust them fully in a production system. \n\nSo uh nowadays like people are very keen on building agents. I think uh identity and access management and security should be a thought that we give consideration from the day one because it shouldn't come as a afterthought because if we want to apply those concept later on the development or deployment journey then that will be quite hard or the damage might already be done.",

This highlights its superior capability in tackling com-\nplex tasks in healthcare applications.

Our bootstrapping philosophy\nis to progressively adapt heterogeneous comprehension and\ngeneration knowledge to pre-trained large language mod-\nels (LLMs). This is achieved through a novel heterogeneous\nlow-rank adaptation (H-LoRA) technique, which is com-\nplemented by a tailored hierarchical visual perception ap-\nproach and a three-stage learning strategy. To effectively\nlearn the HealthGPT, we devise a comprehensive medi-\ncal domain-specific comprehension and generation dataset\ncalled VL-Health. Experimental results demonstrate ex-\nceptional performance and scalability of HealthGPT in\nmedical visual unified tasks.

        "page_content": "Specifically, recent studies (Li et al. 2024a; Tu et al. 2024)\nhave utilized pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and\nvisual instruction data to build interactive diagnostic tools\nand treatment planning systems, revealing the immense po-\ntential of LVLMs in medical scenarios. However, these stud-\nies primarily concentrate on visual comprehension tasks that\nproduce text-based outputs, such as medical visual ques-\ntion answering (Li et al. 2024a) or report generation (Nath\net al. 2024), and deficient the “drawing” capability needed\nfor medical visual generation. In practice, integrating visual\ncomprehension and generation can significantly enhance the\nmultifunctionality of medical LVLMs.\nRecent studies have increasingly focused on developing\nunified LVLMs capable of comprehending and generating\ncontent across diverse visual modalities. Earlier approaches\npredominantly utilized continuous visual tokens fed into\nLLMs, using the LLMs themselves as conditional genera-\ntors for external generative models (Ge et al. 2024; Wu et al.\n2023; Dong et al. 2023). More recent research has explored\nthe use of discrete visual tokens for image representation and\ngeneration within a fully autoregressive framework (Team\n2024; Wang et al. 2024a; Xie et al. 2024). These meth-\nods not only enhance controllability but also demonstrate\nearly success in open-world, any-to-any tasks, highlighting\nthe preliminary potential of a unified autoregressive learning\nparadigm in multi-modal tasks.\nWhile unified LVLMs have achieved initial success in\ngeneral scenarios, such a unified framework remains under-\nexplored in the medical domain. Adapting the aforemen-\ntioned general unified model paradigm to the medical do-\nmain presents two major challenges: (i) High-scale and\n-quality Data Limitations . Open-world models necessi-\ntate extensive pre-training on billions or even more diverse,\nmulti-modal data samples for comprehension and genera-\ntion tasks (Lu et al. 2024; Team 2024). However, the ac-\ncessible medical data significantly lacks in scale and qual-\nity compared to natural multi-modal datasets. Its special-\nized and domain-specific characteristics make it challenging\nto develop a unified medical model from scratch. (ii) Con-\nflicts between Comprehension and Generation . Compre-\nhension tasks often strip away visual details to focus on\nabstraction, while generation tasks require detailed preser-\nvation, making tokens sensitive to all visual alterations. As\nshown in Figure 2, which features experiments conducted on\nmedical images, the performance in comprehension (or gen-\neration) tasks steadily decreases as the proportion of genera-\ntion (or comprehension) data increases, and vice versa. This\nhighlights a dilemma in autoregressive multi-modal training,\nstemming from the need to maintain consistency between\npre- and post-LVLMs. While some methods have explored\nmutual enhancement between comprehension and genera-\ntion (Pan et al. 2024; Tong et al. 2024), improvements still\nexhibit diminishing returns, with performance degradation\nremaining a significant issue.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2: With a fixed amount of comprehension (genera-\ntion) data, increasing the proportion of the other type leads\nto significant performance degradation.\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose\nHealthGPT (see Figure 1) , which progressively adapts a\npre-trained LLM as an unified medical multi-modal model\nwith a small amount of visual instruction data. We de-\nvise innovative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) ap-\nproach (Ding et al. 2023), calledHeterogeneous Low-Rank\nAdaptation (H-LoRA), which decouples the learning pro-\ncess of LVLMs for comprehension and generation tasks. In-\nspired by the plug-and-play nature of LoRA (Hu et al. 2021),\nH-LoRA enables the model to store heterogeneous compre-\nhension and generation knowledge in independent “plug-\nins”, thus avoiding joint optimization issues caused by con-\nflicts between comprehension and generation tasks. In addi-\ntion, we also consider the variety of sub-tasks among com-\nprehension or generation tasks. Qualitative research high-\nlights the limitations of a single LoRA in handling multi-\ndimensional task scenarios, mainly due to catastrophic for-\ngetting and interference (Liu et al. 2024d; Lin et al. 2024).\nTo address this, we draw on the concept of Mixture of Ex-\nperts (MoE) (Masoudnia and Ebrahimpour 2014) and in-\ntroduce LoRA experts. The aim is to dynamically transfer\ntask-shared knowledge to adapt to downstream tasks. Unlike\nMoELoRA (Luo et al. 2024a), H-LoRA employs reversible\nmatrix block multiplication to combine LoRA experts, sig-\nnificantly reducing the overhead of multiple matrix multi-\nplications. Notably, when using four experts, it requires\nonly 67% of the MoELoRA training time.\nTo effectively leverage H-LoRA inHealthGPT, we fur-\nther introduce a Hierarchical Visual Perception (HVP)\nand devise a correspondingThree-stage Learning Strategy\n(TLS). HVP: we separate visual details learning from Vi-\nsion transformer (ViT) for comprehension and generation.\nAs is widely recognized, the ViT encodes visual concepts\nwith increasing abstraction, generally, becoming finer as we\nprogress over levels (Vig 2019). Thus, we maintain the vi-\nsual features of the anterior and posterior layers to accom-\nmodate the differing requirements for visual granularity in\ncomprehension and generation tasks while preventing po-\n2",

TLS: In the first and second stages,\ngiven the heterogeneity between comprehension and gener-\nation tasks, we first train H-LoRA plugins for HealthGPT\nto incorporate both medical comprehension and generation\nknowledge, thus endowing the LLMs with capabilities for\nvision-language alignment and vision-to-vision reconstruc-\ntion. Additionally, through minimal mixed-task training, we\nbuilt fusion embedding layers and output heads that merge\ntext and visual tokens, establishing a unified LVLM founda-\ntion for visual instruction fine-tuning. In the third stage, by\nonly training the H-LoRA plugins, HealthGPT is able to\nrapidly adapt to a wide range of downstream medical tasks,\ncovering various types of medical comprehension and gen-\neration tasks.\nTo effectively implement our approach, we have cu-\nrated a dataset for training unified medical LVLMs, called\nVL-Health, including seven comprehension tasks and five\ngeneration tasks (Figure 1). Through quantitative analysis\nand validation on multi-modal tasks, the results demonstrate\nthat HealthGPT is capable of unifying medical multi-\nmodal abilities in data-constrained scenarios, achieving per-\nformance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-\nart (SOTA) models across multiple metrics. Overall, the\nmain contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n• Unified Med-LVLM. We introduce HealthGPT,\nwhich, to the best of our knowledge, is the first unified\nframework for multi-modal comprehension and genera-\ntion in complex medical scenarios.\n• Effective Learning Paradigm. We present H-LoRA, an\noptimized multi-LoRA PEFT architecture based on task-\ngated decoupling, is designed to effectively mitigate data\nconflict issues.\n• Holistic Training Dataset. We curated VL-Health, a\ncomprehensive dataset designed for both comprehension\nand generation tasks.\n• Superior Downstream Improvements : Extensive ex-\nperiments are conducted and the results confirm\nHealthGPT’s effectiveness in medical vision-language\ncomprehension and generation.\n2 Related Work\nMedical Vision Large Language Models. Recently, medi-\ncal vision large language models (Med-VLLMs) have made\nsignificant progress, demonstrating excellent performance\nin understanding medical images and responding to human\nqueries based on these images (Zhou et al. 2023; Tian et al.\n2023). XrayGPT (Thawkar et al. 2023) combines a med-\nical visual encoder (MedClip) (Wang et al. 2022) with a\nfine-tuned LLM , using a simple linear transformation layer\nto achieve alignment between visual and textual informa-\ntion, significantly enhancing the understanding of medical\nimages. On this basis, LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) fur-\nther enhances visual-text alignment in medical contexts by\nselecting high-quality image-text pairs from PubMed pa-\npers and synthesized VQA datasets. BiomedGPT (Luo et al.\n2024b) employs a BERT-style encoder and GPT-style de-\ncoder architecture, pre-trained on interdisciplinary datasets.\nCompared to commercial models like Med-PaLM (Singhal\net al. 2023), BiomedGPT significantly reduces model size\nwhile maintaining superior performance. However, issues\nof language adaptability and dataset specificity still remain.\nTo address these, HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)\nintroduces the PubMedVision dataset, which contains 1.3\nmillion high-quality medical samples, significantly improv-\ning the model’s adaptability across diverse medical applica-\ntions. However, current Med-VLLMs mainly focus on med-\nical comprehension and lack the capability for the medical\nvision-language generation.\nUnified Visual Comprehension and Generation Mod-\nels. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on cre-\nating unified LVLMs that are adept at understanding and\nproducing content across various visual modalities. NExT-\nGPT (Wu et al. 2023) achieves perception and generation for\narbitrary combinations of multi-modal inputs and outputs by\naligning LLMs. Similarly, SEED (Ge et al. 2023), SEED-\nX (Ge et al. 2024), and DreamLLM (Dong et al. 2023) em-\nploy learnable queries and leverage next-token prediction to\ngenerate visual tokens, providing conditional inputs to exter-\nnal generation modules. Unlike these methods, which func-\ntion as external conditioners, Unified-IO (Lu et al. 2022),\nUnified-IO 2 (Lu et al. 2024), and Chameleon (Team 2024)\ninternalize multi-modal generation tasks within a unified\nTransformer architecture by extending multi-modal vocab-\nularies, enabling direct generation based on next-token pre-\ndiction. Building on this concept, Lumina-mGPT (Liu et al.\n2024a) and ANOLE (Chern et al. 2024) further enhance the\ngeneration capabilities of unified models using high-quality\ndata, particularly improving the quality and flexibility of im-\nage generation.\n3 Preliminaries\nLarge Vision-Language Models.The input to a LVLM typ-\nically consists of an image ximg and a discrete text sequence\nxtxt. The visual encoder Eimg converts the input image ximg\ninto a sequence of visual tokens V = [ vi]Nv\ni=1, while the\ntext sequence xtxt is mapped into a sequence of text to-\nkens T = [ ti]Nt\ni=1 using an embedding function Etxt. The\nLLM MLLM(·|θ) models the joint probability of the token\nsequence U = {V, T }, which is expressed as:\nPθ(R|U) =\nNrY\ni=1\nPθ(ri|{U, r<i}), (1)\nwhere R = [ri]Nr\ni=1 is the text response sequence. The LVLM\niteratively generates the next token ri based on r<i. The op-\ntimization objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss of\nthe response R. It is worth noting that most LVLMs adopt\n3",

VQGAN (Esser, Rombach, and Ommer 2021)\nemploys latent space compression and indexing mechanisms\nto effectively learn a complete discrete representation of im-\nages. VQGAN first maps the input imageximg to a latent rep-\nresentation z = E(x) through a encoder E. Then, the latent\nrepresentation is quantized using a codebookZ = {zk}K\nk=1,\ngenerating a discrete index sequence I = [im]N\nm=1, where\nim ∈ Zrepresents the quantized code index:\nI = Quantize(z|Z) = arg min\nzk∈Z\n∥z − zk∥2. (2)\nIn our approach, the discrete index sequence I serves as\na supervisory signal for the generation task, enabling the\nmodel to predict the index sequence ˆI from input conditions\nsuch as text or other modality signals. Finally, the predicted\nindex sequence ˆI is upsampled by the VQGAN decoder G,\ngenerating the high-quality image ˆximg = G(ˆI).\nLow Rank Adaptation. LoRA(Hu et al. 2021) effectively\ncaptures the characteristics of downstream tasks by intro-\nducing low-rank adapters. The core idea is to decompose\nthe bypass weight matrix ∆W ∈ Rdin×dout\ninto two low-\nrank matrices {A ∈ Rdin×r, B ∈ Rr×dout\n}, where r ≪\nmin{din, dout}, significantly reducing learnable parameters.\nThe output with the LoRA adapter for the input x is then\ngiven by:\nh = xW0 + αx∆W/r = xW0 + αxAB/r, (3)\nwhere matrix A is initialized with a Gaussian distribution,\nwhile the matrixB is initialized as a zero matrix. The scaling\nfactor α/r controls the impact of ∆W on the model.\n4 HealthGPT\n4.1 Unified Autoregressive Generation.\nHealthGPT (Figure 3) utilizes a discrete token representa-\ntion that covers both text and visual outputs, unifying visual\ncomprehension and generation as an autoregressive task. For\ncomprehension, Mllm receives the input joint sequence U\nand outputs a series of text token R = [ r1, r2, . . . , rNr ],\nwhere ri ∈ Vtxt, and Vtxt represents the LLM’s vocabulary:\nPθ(R | U) =\nNrY\ni=1\nPθ(ri | U, r<i). (4)\nFor generation, Mllm first receives a special start token\n⟨START IMG⟩, then generates a series of tokens corre-\nsponding to the VQGAN indices I = [ i1, i2, . . . , iNi ],\nwhere ij ∈ Vvq, and Vvq represents the index range of VQ-\nGAN. Upon completion of generation, the LLM outputs an\nend token ⟨END IMG⟩:\nPθ(I | U) =\nNiY\nj=1\nPθ(ij | U, i<j). (5)\nFinally, the generated index sequence I is fed into the de-\ncoder G, which reconstructs the target image ˆximg = G(I).\n4.2 Hierarchical Visual Perception\nGiven the differences in visual perception between compre-\nhension and generation tasks—where the former focuses on\nabstract semantics and the latter emphasizes complete se-\nmantics—we employ ViT to compress the image into dis-\ncrete visual tokens at multiple hierarchical levels. Specif-\nically, the image is converted into a series of features\n{f1, f2, . . . , fL} as it passes through L ViT blocks.\n4",

At the task level, for each task type\nT, we dynamically assign a dedicated H-LoRA submodule\nθT , which is expressed as:\nR = MLLM(U|θ, θT ), θ T = {AT , BT , RT\nouter}. (7)\nAt the feature level for a single task, H-LoRA integrates the\nidea of Mixture of Experts (MoE) (Masoudnia and Ebrahim-\npour 2014) and designs an efficient matrix merging and rout-\ning weight allocation mechanism, thus avoiding the signif-\nicant computational delay introduced by matrix splitting in\nexisting MoELoRA (Luo et al. 2024a). Specifically, we first\nmerge the low-rank matrices (rank = r) of k LoRA experts\ninto a unified matrix:\nAmerged, Bmerged = Concat({Ai}k\n1 ), Concat({Bi}k\n1 ), (8)\nwhere Amerged ∈ Rdin×rk and Bmerged ∈ Rrk×dout\n. The\nk-dimension routing layer generates expert weights W ∈\nRtoken num×k based on the input hidden state x, and these are\nexpanded to Rtoken num×rk as follows:\nWexpanded = αkW/r ⊗ 1r, (9)\nwhere ⊗ denotes the replication operation. The overall out-\nput of H-LoRA is computed as:\nOH-LoRA = (xAmerged ⊙ Wexpanded)Bmerged, (10)\nwhere ⊙ represents element-wise multiplication. Finally, the\noutput of H-LoRA is added to the frozen pre-trained weights\nto produce the final output:\nO = xW0 + OH-LoRA. (11)\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\nComp.

In the first stage, we\ndesign separate visual adapters and H-LoRA submodules for\nmedical unified tasks. For the medical comprehension task,\nwe train abstract-grained visual adapters using high-quality\nimage-text pairs to align visual embeddings with textual\nembeddings, thereby enabling the model to accurately de-\nscribe medical visual content. During this process, the pre-\ntrained LLM and its corresponding H-LoRA submodules\nremain frozen. In contrast, the medical generation task re-\nquires training concrete-grained adapters and H-LoRA sub-\nmodules while keeping the LLM frozen. Meanwhile, we ex-\ntend the textual vocabulary to include multimodal tokens,\nenabling the support of additional VQGAN vector quanti-\nzation indices. The model trains on image-VQ pairs, en-\ndowing the pre-trained LLM with the capability for image\nreconstruction. This design ensures pixel-level consistency\nof pre- and post-LVLM. The processes establish the initial\nalignment between the LLM’s outputs and the visual inputs.\n2nd Stage: Heterogeneous H-LoRA Plugin Adaptation.\nThe submodules of H-LoRA share the word embedding\nlayer and output head but may encounter issues such as\nbias and scale inconsistencies during training across dif-\nferent tasks. To ensure that the multiple H-LoRA plugins\nseamlessly interface with the LLMs and form a unified base,\nwe fine-tune the word embedding layer and output head us-\ning a small amount of mixed data to maintain consistency\nin the model weights. Specifically, during this stage, all H-\nLoRA submodules for different tasks are kept frozen, with\nonly the word embedding layer and output head being op-\ntimized. Through this stage, the model accumulates foun-\ndational knowledge for unified tasks by adapting H-LoRA\nplugins.\n3rd Stage: Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning. In the third\nstage, we introduce additional task-specific data to fur-\nther optimize the model and enhance its adaptability to\ndownstream tasks such as medical visual comprehension\n(e.g., medical QA, medical dialogues, and report generation)\nor generation tasks (e.g., super-resolution, denoising, and\n5",

Notably, by this stage, the word em-\nbedding layer and output head have been fine-tuned, only the\nH-LoRA modules and adapter modules need to be trained.\nThis strategy significantly improves the model’s adaptability\nand flexibility across different tasks.\n5 Experiments\n5.1 Data and Experimental Setup\nData Details. We curate VL-Health dataset (see Fig-\nure 4). For medical visual comprehension, we leverage\nmultiple medical-specific datasets, including PubMedVi-\nsion (Chen et al. 2024a), LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b),\nPathVQA (He et al. 2020), MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), and VQA-RAD (Lau\net al. 2018). Additionally, we incorporate high-quality open-\nworld data from LLaV A-1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b) to preserve\nthe model’s general knowledge and instruction-following\ncapabilities. For generation tasks, we construct a recon-\nstruction dataset based on LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b),\nand also explore two key tasks in personalized medical\nimage enhancement—super-resolution and modality con-\nversion—using the IXI (Davies et al. 2014) and Syn-\nthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) datasets. Detailed data\nselection and instruction templates are in the Appendix.\nModel Details. We select CLIP-L/14 (Radford et al. 2021)\nas the visual encoder and used the hidden states of its\nsecond and penultimate layers as concrete-grained and\nabstract-grained features for model’s dynamic hierarchical\nvisual perception. Drawing on the successful experiences of\nLLaV A, we employ a MLP to align the multi-modal fea-\nture embeddings. We choose the parameter-efficient phi-3-\nmini (Abdin et al. 2024) and phi-4 (Abdin et al. 2024) as the\nbase model. For visual comprehension and generation tasks,\nwe set the rank of H-LoRA to 16 and 64, with four experts.\nAdditionally, we use the f8-8192 version of VQGAN as the\nimage indexing and upsampling module.\n5.2 Main Experiments\nComprehension. We compare HealthGPT with several\nexisting models, including medical-specific LVLMs (e.g.,\nMed-Flamingo (Moor et al. 2023), LLaV A-Med (Li et al.\n2024b), HuatuoGPT-Vision (Chen et al. 2024a)) as well\nas recent open-world LVLMs (e.g., BLIP-2 (Li et al.\n2023b), LLaV A-v1.5 (Liu et al. 2024b), InstructBLIP (Dai\net al. 2023), Yi-VL (Young et al. 2024), InternVL2 (Chen\n6",

Addition-\nally, we test several SOTA unified visual comprehension\nand generation models, including Show-o (Xie et al. 2024),\nUnified-IO 2 (Lu et al. 2024), and Janus (Wu et al.\n2024). The experimental results are shown in Table 1, with\nthe following key observations: (i) SOTA Results Com-\npared with LVLMs: In medical visual comprehension\ntasks, HealthGPT demonstrates superior performance,\nsignificantly outperforming both medical-specific models\n(e.g., HuatuoGPT-Vision) and general-purpose models (e.g.,\nLlama-3.2). (ii) Surpassing Current Unified LVLMs: De-\nspite being trained on billions of data points, unified mod-\nels still exhibit poor generalization performance in medi-\ncal visual comprehension. For instance, Unified-IO 2 scored\nonly 33.8. In contrast,HealthGPT-M3, with only 3.8B pa-\nrameters, scored 61.3 on the medical multi-modal unified\ntask, significantly outperforming existing unified models in\nmedical downstream scenarios. (iii) Stable Improvement\nwith Large Base Model: Our method demonstrates excel-\nlent scalability, with HealthGPT-L14 achieving a score\nof 66.4 in the larger model configuration. This result signif-\nicantly outperforms all other models, highlighting the effec-\ntiveness of scaling up the base model for enhanced perfor-\nmance in medical tasks.\nGeneration. We study three key tasks in medical imag-\ning. (i) Modality Conversion: In this task, we focus on\nthe conversion between CT and MRI modalities for the\nbrain and pelvic regions, designing four specific sub-tasks.\nAll comparative models (Pix2Pix (Isola et al. 2017), Cy-\ncleGAN (Zhu et al. 2017), BBDM (Li et al. 2023a),\n(%)\n(%)\n（a） （b）\nFigure 6: The loss visualization (a) and performance com-\nparison (b) with respect to different visual perceptions.\nVmamba (Liu et al. 2024e), and DiffMa (Wang et al.\n2024b)) trained a separate model for each sub-task, while\nHealthGPT unify all tasks into a single training process.\nThe experimental results, shown in Table 11, demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms other methods across multi-\nple evaluation metrics. For instance, in the CT2MRI-Brain\ntask, HealthGPT-M3 achieves an SSIM of 79.38, signif-\nicantly surpassing traditional methods like Pix2Pix (71.09)\nand the recent DiffMa (71.47). (ii) Super-Resolution: We\nconduct 4× super-resolution experiments on the IXI dataset,\nwith the results presented in Table 3. Notably, most exist-\ning methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge of key\nstructures in medical images, resulting in significant short-\ncomings in detail recovery. In contrast, our method signif-\nicantly mitigates this issue. Specifically, HealthGPT-M3\nexcels in key metrics such as SSIM, PSNR, and ISE, achiev-\ning scores of 78.19, 32.76, and 34.47, respectively. Ad-\nditionally, HealthGPT-M3 achieves the lowest score of\n12.34, further validating its exceptional performance in hu-\nman visual perception. (iii) Reconstruction: We compare\nHealthGPT-M3 with unified models with reconstruction\ncapabilities, such as Unified-IO 2 and SEED-X. The results\nshow that our approach performs better controllability for vi-\nsual reconstruction. We also trainHealthGPT-L14 with a\nsimilar number of trainable parameters to the M3 version.\nHence, the similar performance between the two models\nmeets our expectations. Details are in the Appendix.\n5.3 In-Depth Study\nEffect of Heterogeneous Low-Rank Adaptation.H-LoRA\nprovides an optimized multi-LoRA architecture for multi-\ntask learning. We conduct extensive validation of this struc-\nture, with results presented in Table 4, comparing the per-\nformance of LoRA, MoELoRA, and H-LoRA in medical\nunified comprehension and generation tasks. In the majority\nof comprehension tasks and all generation tasks, H-LoRA\ndemonstrates superior performance, particularly in the Om-\nniMedVQA benchmark, where it improved from 64.90 to\n68.50. Notably, despite some applications of MoELoRA in\ncertain scenarios, it do not show advantages in this task and\n7",

We propose a three-stage\nlearning strategy for H-LoRA that decouples comprehension\nand generation tasks. Unlike methods that train both tasks\nsimultaneously, our approach reduces performance degra-\ndation from task conflicts (see Table 5). In the medical vi-\nsual comprehension task, mixed training causes catastrophic\nforgetting and degrades visual reconstruction, whereas our\nstrategy effectively uses the medical embedding knowledge\nin pre-trained LLMs to mitigate these conflicts. Meanwhile,\nwe examine how fusing heterogeneous H-LoRA plugins in\nthe second training stage results in minimal performance\ndegradation. Detailed results are in the Appendix.\nHierarchical Visual Perception Analysis. We conduct an\nablation analysis on visual perceptual inputs for comprehen-\nsion and generation tasks. Figure 6 shows that comprehen-\nsion tasks converge more efficiently with abstract-grained\ninputs, while generation tasks perform better with concrete-\ngrained inputs. This highlights the importance of the hier-\narchical visual perception we propose, suggesting that tai-\nloring visual inputs for specific tasks at different hierarchies\ncan significantly improve efficiency.\nReport-to-CXR Task. We further explore the medical im-\nage generation task without reference images, using a small\namount of MIMIC-CXR data (Johnson et al. 2019) for in-\nstruction fine-tuning. Figure 7 annotates images with vary-\ning injury degrees and locations, comparing them to healthy\nCXR images. We observe thatHealthGPT effectively gen-\nerates CXR images based on the instructions, showcasing its\npotential in healthcare education and auxiliary diagnosis.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduceHealthGPT, a Med-LVLM that\nunifies medical vision-language comprehension and gen-\neration through a novel heterogeneous knowledge adap-\ntation approach. Experimental results demonstrate that\nHealthGPT achieves significant performance improve-\nments across multiple medical comprehension and genera-\ntion tasks, showcasing its potential for healthcare applica-\n8",

        "page_content": "Appendix\nThis is the Appendix for “HealthGPT: A Medical Large Vision-Language Model for Unifying Comprehension and Generation\nvia Heterogeneous Knowledge Adaptation”. This Appendix is organized as follows:\n• Section A presents the experimental implementation details, the training process of HealthGPT, and the specifics of\nVL-Health.\n• Section B systematically provides an analysis of Heterogeneous Low-Rank Adaptation.\n• Section C shows supplementary experimental results to validate the effectiveness ofHealthGPT.\nA Implementation Details\nA.1 Model Details\nWe employ CLIP-L/14 (Radford et al. 2021) as the visual feature extractor, extracting both shallow and deep features to serve as\nvisual tokens. The model uses alignment adapters, implemented with two-layer MLPs, to align shallow features, representing\nconcrete visual granularity, and deep features, representing abstract visual granularity. These visual tokens are concatenated\nwith text tokens and input into the large language models (LLMs).\nHealthGPT offers two versions: HealthGPT-M3 and HealthGPT-L14, which are based on Phi-3-mini (Abdin et al.\n2024) and Phi-4 (Abdin et al. 2024) as the pre-trained LLMs, respectively. In addition, we expand the LLM vocabulary with\n8192 VQ indices derived from VQGAN-f8-8192 (Esser, Rombach, and Ommer 2021), serving as multi-modal tokens to further\naugment the model’s capacity for understanding both visual and textual input. Figure 6 shows the details.\nTable 6: Overview of the Components of HealthGPT.\nModel ViT Adapter MLP-dims Model dims LLM Params Vocab Size H-LoRA Rank\nHealthGPT-M3 CLIP-L/14 2-layer MLP 1024 3072 Phi-3-mini 3.8B 40206 16(Comp.), 64(Gen.)\nHealthGPT-L14 CLIP-L/14 2-layer MLP 1024 5120 Phi-4 14B 108547 8(Comp.), 32(Gen.)\nA.2 Training Details\nIn this study, we propose a three-stage learning strategy that is compatible with our innovative heterogeneous low-rank adapta-\ntion (H-LoRA). We provide a detailed hyperparameter configuration for the model’s three-stage training process. The specific\nhyperparameter settings used are listed in Table 7. These hyperparameters are crucial for ensuring the model’s learning efficacy\nand final performance.\nTable 7: Overview of Hyperparameter Configurations.\nHealthGPT-M3 HealthGPT-L14\nStage-1 Stage-2 Stage-3 Stage-1 Stage-2 Stage-3Hyperparameter\nComp.

Through repeated validation, we discovered that larger model parameters and learning rates tend to lead to\nthis issue, which is the reason for the slight differences in hyperparameters betweenHealthGPT-M3 and HealthGPT-L14.\n12",

For comprehension tasks, we selected datasets\nsuch as VQA-RAD (Lau et al. 2018), SLAKE (Liu et al. 2021), PathVQA (He et al. 2020), and MIMIC-CXR-VQA (Bae et al.\n2024), which cover various medical imaging modalities like radiology and pathology, and include professional annotations\nto assist the model in learning tasks such as lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Additionally, large-scale multi-modal\ndatasets like LLaV A-Med (Li et al. 2024b) and PubMedVision (Chen et al. 2024a) were included to provide broader medical\nknowledge support and facilitate the training of complex reasoning tasks. For generation tasks, we focused on four mainstream\ntask categories: super-resolution image generation, modality conversion, text-to-image generation, and image reconstruction.\nThe IXI (Davies et al. 2014) dataset, containing a large number of healthy brain MRI images, is suitable for training super-\nresolution models; the MIMIC-CHEST-XRAY (Bae et al. 2024) dataset, with X-ray images and their corresponding textual\nreports, is appropriate for text-to-image generation tasks; the SynthRAD2023 (Thummerer et al. 2023) dataset provides a large\nnumber of paired CT and MRI images, supporting modality conversion model training; for image reconstruction tasks, we\nrewrote and adjusted the LLaV A-558k (Liu et al. 2024b) dataset.\nData Processing: After data collection, we performed filtering and processing of the raw data. For VisualQA tasks, we stan-\ndardized the data entries into two forms: open-ended questions and single-choice questions, enabling flexible training and\nevaluation. Additionally, considering that multi-image data has a minimal impact on performance but introduces extra padding\nand training time, we excluded multi-image data. For the scanned image data in generation tasks, we applied slicing extrac-\ntion, image registration, data augmentation, and normalization to treat 2D images as visual inputs for model training or used\nVQGAN-generated indices to supervise the generation tasks.\nData Statistics This section provides detailed statistical information about the VL-Health dataset to offer a more compre-\nhensive understanding.\nData Overview: To ensure a balanced development of the model’s comprehension and generation capabilities, in addition\nto the LLaV A-558k and PubMedVision-PT datasets used for alignment, the VL-Health dataset ultimately selected 765,802\nadditional visual question-answering (VQA) training samples (to endow the model with visual comprehension and instruction-\nfollowing capabilities) and 783,045 generation training samples (to provide the model with reconstruction and visual generation\ninstruction-following abilities). This contributes to the transfer of knowledge between comprehension and generation tasks, en-\nhancing the model’s overall performance. For medical image comprehension tasks, images were selected from VQA-RAD (ap-\nproximately 450 images), SLAKE (approximately 630 images), PathVQA (approximately 2,600 images), MIMIC-CXR-VQA\n(approximately 52,000 images), LLaV A-Med (approximately 61,000 images), and PubMedVision (approximately 500,000 im-\nages). Multiple question-answer pairs were retained for each image to enhance the model’s understanding and generalization\nof the image content. Table 8 shows the data distribution ofVL-Health for three-stage learning strategy, where mixed-47k is\nbased on the sampling of all data in stage-1.\nDiversity and Quality Assessment: VL-Health covers 11 modalities, including CT, MRI, X-ray, microscopy, OCT, ultra-\nsound, and fundus photography, which aids the model in learning features from various modalities. The dataset also encom-\npasses a wide range of diseases, from common to rare, and from localized lesions to systemic diseases, including pulmonary\ndiseases, skeletal abnormalities, brain lesions, tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and cellular abnormalities. This provides com-\nprehensive training support to the model, enabling it to learn the characteristics and diagnosis of various diseases.\n13",

All data samples are converted into a unified instruction-response format for training and evaluation. Specifi-\ncally, the VL-Health dataset consists of the following components:\n• Task Type: Specifies the granularity of visual features output by the visual encoder and selects the corresponding H-\nLoRA submodule. For generation tasks, the response also includes multi-modal tokens corresponding to VQ indices.\n• Task Instruction: Guides the model to interpret the image and generate a response, covering various aspects of the\nimage and specifying the output format.\n• Response: The textual output generated based on the task instruction and input image, ensuring it meets the question and\nformatting requirements.\n• Input Image: Provides the visual signal for the model to process.\n• Target Image Index: In generation tasks, this is added as a multi-modal token to the response for autoregressive\ngeneration.\nB Analysis of Heterogeneous Low-Rank Adaptation\nWe propose H-LoRA, which utilizes hard routing selection to allocate plugins for knowledge learning and representation across\ntasks, thereby preventing conflicts arising from heterogeneous knowledge. Furthermore, within each task, we optimized based\non MoELoRA, enhancing performance while reducing computational overhead. The pseudocode is detailed Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1: H-LoRA Algorithm\nInput: concrete-grained visual features FCon, abstract-grained visual featuresFAbs, comprehension-based H-LoRA modules\n({AComp.\ni }k\ni=1, RComp.\nouter ), generation-based H-LoRA modules({AGen.\ni }k\ni=1, RGen.\nouter), task type T (comprehension or generation),\nnumber of LoRA experts k, origin linear layer weights W0, text features T , hidden state h\nOutput: final output O\n// Select task-specific image features\nif T = generation task then\nFimg ← FCon\nelse if T = comprehension task then\nFimg ← FAbs\nend if\nU ←concat(Fimg, T ) // Concatenate image features and text features\n{Ai}k\ni=1, {Bi}k\ni=1, Router ← {AT\ni }k\ni=1, {BT\ni }k\ni=1, RT\nouter // Assign task-specific H-LoRA submodule\n// Merge LoRA experts’ matrices\nAmerged ← concat({Ai}k\ni=1)\nBmerged ← concat({Bi}k\ni=1)\nW ←R(h) // Generate routing weights based on input hidden state x\nWexpanded ← α × W/r ⊗ 1r // Expand routing weights to match merged matrices\nOH-LoRA ← (x · Amerged ⊙ Wexpanded) · Bmerged // Compute H-LoRA output using element-wise multiplication\nO ←x · W0 + OH-LoRA // Add H-LoRA output to pre-trained weights to get final output\nReturn O\nWe further analyzed the computational overhead differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA. Assuming that both methods\nuse the same number of LoRA experts k, we can compare their time complexity from the perspective of the operational steps\ninvolved.\nComputational Overhead of MoELoRA. In MoELoRA, the operations involving the expert matrix mainly include the fol-\nlowing steps: (i) Expert Multiplication : MoELoRA requires 2k multiplications with the LoRA experts. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: One multiplication with the Router is required. (iii) Router Output Expansion : MoELoRA needs to perform k\n14",

        "page_content": "expansion operations on the Router’s output weights to generate the appropriate shapes that match the dimensions of the in-\nput and LoRA experts while iterating through the experts. (iv) Dot Product: For each expanded Router weight, a dot product\nwith the intermediate state of the expert is required, resulting in k multiplications. (v) Addition: Finally, k addition operations\nare required to accumulate the results from each LoRA expert into the final output. Assuming the time complexity of each\noperation is the same, the additional time complexity introduced when equipping a fully connected layer with MoELoRA is:\nO(2k+1+ k+k+k) = O(5k+1). Thus, MoELoRA introduces an additional time overhead ofO(5k+1) during computation.\nH-LoRA. In contrast to MoELoRA, H-LoRA reduces the computational overhead by concatenating the LoRA expert matrices.\nSpecifically: (i) Expert Multiplication: H-LoRA merges all LoRA experts by directly creating a larger A and B matrix, instead\nof performing independent operations for each expert. This process can be implemented through matrix initialization without\nadditional concatenation operations. Therefore, only 2 multiplications with the LoRA experts are required. (ii) Router Multi-\nplication: H-LoRA still requires one multiplication with the Router. (iii) Router Output Expansion : H-LoRA only requires\none expansion operation on the Router’s output weights. (iv) Dot Product: H-LoRA only requires one dot product between\nthe Router’s output and the expert’s intermediate state. (v) Addition: Finally, H-LoRA only requires one addition operation\nto accumulate the LoRA expert results into the intermediate state. Therefore, the additional time complexity introduced by\nH-LoRA is: O(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =O(6).\nComparing the two, we see that MoELoRA introduces a linear increase in additional time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of experts k, resulting in a complexity of O(5k + 1), while H-LoRA’s additional time complexity is fixed at O(6),\nindependent of k. We observe that when k is small, the time complexity differences between MoELoRA and H-LoRA are\nnegligible. However, as k increases, MoELoRA’s computational overhead grows linearly, while H-LoRA’s remains constant.\nThis makes H-LoRA significantly more computationally efficient than MoELoRA, particularly in large-scale tasks. We will\nfurther demonstrate the significant advantage of H-LoRA in training time in subsequent experiments, validating its efficiency\nin practical applications.\nC Supplemental Experimental Results\nIn this section, we include additional experiments to demonstrate the superiority of HealthGPT and articulate our design\nphilosophy.\nC.1 Results: OmniMedVQA Benchmark\nOmniMedVQA (Hu et al. 2024) is a novel, large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to\nencompass various modalities and anatomical regions by collecting diverse images from multiple medical datasets.

        "page_content": "general LVLMs; (ii) the unified model demonstrates relatively weak performance on OmniMedVQA; however, our approach\neffectively mitigates performance degradation caused by generation tasks, serving as a unified model; (iii) HealthGPT-L14\nexcels across all sub-tasks, achieving optimal or near-optimal results with an average score of 74.4, significantly surpassing\nother models.\nC.2 Stability Analysis of Number of Experts\nWe investigated the impact of the number of LoRA experts on model performance within a multi-LoRA architecture, conducting\nextensive experiments on MoELoRA and H-LoRA with varying numbers of experts. The experimental results are presented\nin Table 10. As the number of experts increases, the training time for MoELoRA is significantly prolonged. When n = 8 ,\nthe training time for MoELoRA is twice that of LoRA, whereas H-LoRA incurs no additional training delay and performs\nbetter. It is estimated that at n = 32, the training time for MoELoRA could reach eight times that of LoRA, preventing it from\ncompleting training and inference. This result aligns with the analysis in Appendix B, indicating that H-LoRA not only avoids\nintroducing additional training delays compared to LoRA but also outperforms MoELoRA.\nTable 10: We explored the performance of MoELoRA and H-LoRA with different numbers of LoRA experts.

To address this, we propose a three-phase learning strategy to support H-LoRA, effectively mitigating inter-task\nconflicts. Specifically, the second phase (Heterogeneous H-LoRA Plugin Adaptation) integrates LLMs with different H-LoRA\nplugins into a new unified foundation by mixing the training of the embedding layers and output heads for two tasks. Figure\n9 illustrates the impact of this phase on the performance of medical comprehension and generation tasks. We observe that the\nsecond phase effectively unifies the model with minimal impact on overall performance, significantly alleviating the conflict\nissues arising from mixed training in medical scenarios.\nC.4 Human Evaluation.\n65.7 65.4 67.7 67.0\nFigure 9: Performance changes before and after the\nstage-2.\nWe further conduct human evaluation on the VQA-RAD, SLAKE,\nand PathVQA benchmarks, which contain 1,000 open-ended ques-\ntions. Specifically, we recruit 5 clinicians to rank the randomly shuf-\nfled responses from HealthGPT-L14, LLaV A-Med, HuatuoGPT-\nVision, Llama-3.2, InternVL-2 and Show-o. During the evaluation,\nquestions were randomly selected, and the model-generated responses\nwere anonymized and ranked. The results, as shown in Figure 10, in-\ndicate that HealthGPT was frequently selected as the best answer.\nThis suggests that HealthGPT has further application potential in\nmedical care scenarios.\nC.5 Reconstruction Performance\nCurrently, unified models that align visual features based on recon-\nstruction tasks include pre-LVLMs, post-LVLMs, as well as Unified-\nIO 2 (Lu et al. 2024) and SEED-X (Ge et al. 2024). To investigate the\ncontrollability of visual generation in rigorous settings such as med-\nical contexts, we evaluated the performance of these models in med-\nical image reconstruction in Table 11. Experimental results demon-\nstrate that HealthGPT exhibits the most stable reconstruction per-\nformance with a small amount of data.\n16",
